Lesson 5: 
The agenda does not sum properly
I'm a little concerned about the use of the word 'animate' instead of 'make move', or something similar. We get lots of questions about sprites as it 
is...and I'm afraid that we'll be disappointing people. Did you change it from last year?

Lesson 6:
The agenda only sums to 80
The description in the Introduction section refers the teacher to "see DO NOW", but that section seems to be called Preparations now.

Lesson 7:
You staretd using the "Do Now" language, but it doesn't seem to refer to anything...I guess in training you'll mention it, but it's never clearly 
defined (I think...I could be missing it)

Lesson 8:
This one is really short, coming in at 65 minutes. I know that both times I've used this one it's been hard to keep moving on schedule, but maybe 
that means that revised time estimates would be useful instead of short ones? Is this a deliberate decision? 

Also, did Grem's changes get included? The distance-magenta ones? I guess 
it'd be a nonstandard teaching option, so it won't be in the lesson>?

Lesson 9: Yay!

Supplemental lessons: More yay!

Lastly, you asked what I thought about the workbook format: The first thing that jumps out at me is that there's a space on the Design recipe 
worksheets for Contract, but also a Contract sheet. Is the goal to have them write the contract multiple times? This seems unlikely to be enforced. 
I like the fact that the students will create a more useable reference by keeping their design recipes together, but I feel like flipping back and 
forth will be frustrating/not done. I'm expecting "Wait, WHERE in the workbook?" and "I can't do it because I can't find it"
