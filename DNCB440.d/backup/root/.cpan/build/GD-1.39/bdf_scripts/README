These are contributed scripts that can be used to convert BDF fonts
into statically-linked fonts suitable for use with GD.  They were
written for earlier versions of GD which had its own special version
of the gd library.  They will need work to adapt for versions of GD
which link to a dynamically loaded libgd (1.20 and higher).
