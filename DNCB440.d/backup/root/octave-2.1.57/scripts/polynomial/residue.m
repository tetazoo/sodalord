## @cindex partial fraction expansion
##
## The function @code{residue} returns @var{r}, @var{p}, @var{k}, and
## @var{e}, where the vector @var{r} contains the residue terms, @var{p}
## contains the pole values, @var{k} contains the coefficients of a direct
## polynomial term (if it exists) and @var{e} is a vector containing the
## powers of the denominators in the partial fraction terms.

function [r, p, k, e] = residue (b, a, toler)

  ## Here's the method used to find the residues.
  ## The partial fraction expansion can be written as:
  ##
  ##
  ##   P(s)    D   M(k)      A(k,m)
  ##   ---- =  #    #    -------------
  ##   Q(s)   k=1  m=1   (s - pr(k))^m
  ##
  ## (# is used to represent a summation) where D is the number of
  ## distinct roots, pr(k) is the kth distinct root, M(k) is the
  ## multiplicity of the root, and A(k,m) is the residue cooresponding
  ## to the kth distinct root with multiplicity m.  For example,
  ##
  ##        s^2            A(1,1)   A(2,1)    A(2,2)
  ## ------------------- = ------ + ------ + -------
  ## s^3 + 4s^2 + 5s + 2    (s+2)    (s+1)   (s+1)^2
  ##
  ## In this case there are two distinct roots (D=2 and pr = [-2 -1]),
  ## the first root has multiplicity one and the second multiplicity
  ## two (M = [1 2]) The residues are actually stored in vector format as
  ## r = [ A(1,1) A(2,1) A(2,2) ].
  ##
  ## We then multiply both sides by Q(s).  Continuing the example:
  ##
  ## s^2 = r(1)*(s+1)^2 + r(2)*(s+1)*(s+2) + r(3)*(s+2)
  ##
  ## or
  ##
  ## s^2 = r(1)*(s^2+2s+1) + r(2)*(s^2+3s+2) +r(3)*(s+2)
  ##
  ## The coefficients of the polynomials on the right are stored in a row
  ## vector called rhs, while the coefficients of the polynomial on the
  ## left is stored in a row vector called lhs.  If the multiplicity of
  ## any root is greater than one we'll also need derivatives of this
  ## equation of order up to the maximum multiplicity minus one.  The
  ## derivative coefficients are stored in successive rows of lhs and
  ## rhs.
  ##
  ## For our example lhs and rhs would be:
  ##
  ##       | 1 0 0 |
  ## lhs = |       |
  ##       | 0 2 0 |
  ##
  ##       | 1 2 1 1 3 2 0 1 2 |
  ## rhs = |                   |
  ##       | 0 2 2 0 2 3 0 0 1 |
  ##
  ## We then form a vector B and a matrix A obtained by evaluating the
  ## polynomials in lhs and rhs at the pole values. If a pole has a
  ## multiplicity greater than one we also evaluate the derivative
  ## polynomials (successive rows) at the pole value.
  ##
  ## For our example we would have
  ##
  ## | 4|   | 1 0 0 |   | r(1) |
  ## | 1| = | 0 0 1 | * | r(2) |
  ## |-2|   | 0 1 1 |   | r(3) |
  ##
  ## We then solve for the residues using matrix division.
