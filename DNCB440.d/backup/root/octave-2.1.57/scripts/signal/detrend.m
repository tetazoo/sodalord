## @deftypefn {Function File} {} detrend (@var{x}, @var{p})
## If @var{x} is a vector, @code{detrend (@var{x}, @var{p})} removes the
## best fit of a polynomial of order @var{p} from the data @var{x}.
##
## If @var{x} is a matrix, @code{detrend (@var{x}, @var{p})} does the same
## for each column in @var{x}.
##
## The second argument is optional.  If it is not specified, a value of 1
## is assumed.  This corresponds to removing a linear trend.
