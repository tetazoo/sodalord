## @deftypefn {Function File} {} spectral_xdf (@var{x}, @var{win}, @var{b})
## Return the spectral density estimator given a data vector @var{x},
## window name @var{win}, and bandwidth, @var{b}.
##
## The window name, e.g., @code{"triangle"} or @code{"rectangle"} is
## used to search for a function called @code{@var{win}_sw}.
##
## If @var{win} is omitted, the triangle window is used.  If @var{b} is
## omitted, @code{1 / sqrt (length (@var{x}))} is used.
