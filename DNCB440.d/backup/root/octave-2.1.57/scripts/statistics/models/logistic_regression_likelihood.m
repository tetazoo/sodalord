## Description: Likelihood in logistic regression

function [g, g1, p, dev] = logistic_regression_likelihood (y, x, beta, z, z1)

  e = exp ([z, x] * beta); e1 = exp ([z1, x] * beta);
  g = e ./ (1 + e); g1 = e1 ./ (1 + e1);
  g = max (y == max (y), g); g1 = min (y > min(y), g1);

  p = g - g1;
  dev = -2 * sum (log (p));
