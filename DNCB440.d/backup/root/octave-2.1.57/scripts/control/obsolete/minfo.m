##  function [systype, nout, nin, ncstates, ndstates] = minfo(inmat)
##
## MINFO:  Determines the type of system matrix.  INMAT can be
##         a varying(*), system, constant, and empty matrix.
##
##    Returns:
##      systype can be one of:
##            varying, system, constant, and empty
##      nout is the number of outputs of the system
##      nin is the number of inputs of the system
##      ncstates is the number of continuous states of the system
##       ndstates is the number of discrete states of the system
