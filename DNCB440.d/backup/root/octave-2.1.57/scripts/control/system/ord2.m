## @deftypefn {Function File} {} ord2 (@var{nfreq}, @var{damp}, @var{gain})
## Creates a continuous 2nd order system with parameters:
## @strong{Inputs}
## @table @var
## @item nfreq
## natural frequency [Hz]. (not in rad/s)
## @item damp
## damping coefficient
## @item gain
## dc-gain
## This is steady state value only for damp > 0.
## gain is assumed to be 1.0 if ommitted.
## @end table
## @strong{Outputs}
## @var{outsys}
## system data structure has representation with @math{w = 2 * pi * nfreq}:
## @example
##     /                                        \
##     | / -2w*damp -w \  / w \                 |
## G = | |             |, |   |, [ 0  gain ], 0 |
##     | \   w       0 /  \ 0 /                 |
##     \                                        /
