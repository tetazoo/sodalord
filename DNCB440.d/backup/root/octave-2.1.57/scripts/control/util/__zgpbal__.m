##
## used internally in @code{tzero}; minimal argument checking performed
##
## implementation of zero computation generalized eigenvalue problem
## balancing method (Hodel and Tiller, Allerton Conference, 1991)
## Based on Ward's balancing algorithm (SIAM J. Sci Stat. Comput., 1981)
##
## __zgpbal__ computes a state/input/output weighting that attempts to
## reduced the range of the magnitudes of the nonzero elements of [a,b,c,d]
## The weighting uses scalar multiplication by powers of 2, so no roundoff
## will occur.
##
## __zgpbal__ should be followed by zgpred
