## Modify or display Octave's @code{LOADPATH}.
##
## If @var{nargin} and @var{nargout} are zero, display the elements of
## Octave's @code{LOADPATH} in an easy to read format.
##
## If @var{nargin} is zero and nargout is greater than zero, return the
## current value of @code{LOADPATH}.
##
## If @var{nargin} is greater than zero, concatenate the arguments,
## separating them with @code{":"}.  Set @code{LOADPATH} to the result
## and also return it.
##
## No checks are made for duplicate elements.
