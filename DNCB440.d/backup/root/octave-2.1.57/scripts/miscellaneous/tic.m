## @deftypefn {Function File} {} tic ()
## @deftypefnx {Function File} {} toc ()
## These functions set and check a wall-clock timer.  For example,
##
## @example
## tic ();
## # many computations later...
## elapsed_time = toc ();
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## will set the variable @code{elapsed_time} to the number of seconds since
## the most recent call to the function @code{tic}.
##
## If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used, you
## should use the @code{cputime} function instead.  The @code{tic} and
## @code{toc} functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed
## between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other jobs or
## doing nothing at all.  For example,
##
## @example
## @group
## tic (); sleep (5); toc ()
##      @result{} 5
## t = cputime (); sleep (5); cputime () - t
##      @result{} 0
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## (This example also illustrates that the CPU timer may have a fairly
## coarse resolution.)
