<P>
Normally, you evaluate expressions simply by typing them at the Octave
prompt, or by asking Octave to interpret commands that you have saved in
a file.


<P>
Sometimes, you may find it necessary to evaluate an expression that has
been computed and stored in a string, or use a string as the name of a
function to call.  The <CODE>eval</CODE> and <CODE>feval</CODE> functions allow you
to do just that, and are necessary in order to evaluate commands that
are not known until run time, or to write functions that will need to
call user-supplied functions.


<P>
@anchor{doc-eval}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U>  <B>eval</B> <I>(<VAR>try</VAR>, <VAR>catch</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX424"></A>
Parse the string <VAR>try</VAR> and evaluate it as if it were an Octave
program.  If that fails, evaluate the string <VAR>catch</VAR>.
The string <VAR>try</VAR> is evaluated in the current context,
so any results remain available after <CODE>eval</CODE> returns.
</DL>


<P>
@anchor{doc-feval}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Function:</U>  <B>feval</B> <I>(<VAR>name</VAR>, ...)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX425"></A>
Evaluate the function named <VAR>name</VAR>.  Any arguments after the first
are passed on to the named function.  For example,



<PRE>
feval ("acos", -1)
     => 3.1416
</PRE>

<P>
calls the function <CODE>acos</CODE> with the argument <SAMP>`-1'</SAMP>.


<P>
The function <CODE>feval</CODE> is necessary in order to be able to write
functions that call user-supplied functions, because Octave does not
have a way to declare a pointer to a function (like C) or to declare a
special kind of variable that can be used to hold the name of a function
(like <CODE>EXTERNAL</CODE> in Fortran).  Instead, you must refer to functions
by name, and use <CODE>feval</CODE> to call them.
</DL>


<P>
Here is a simple-minded function using <CODE>feval</CODE> that finds the root
of a user-supplied function of one variable using Newton's method.



<PRE>
<A NAME="IDX426"></A><A NAME="IDX427"></A>function result = newtroot (fname, x)

# usage: newtroot (fname, x)
#
#   fname : a string naming a function f(x).
#   x     : initial guess

  delta = tol = sqrt (eps);
  maxit = 200;
  fx = feval (fname, x);
  for i = 1:maxit
    if (abs (fx) &#60; tol)
      result = x;
      return;
    else
      fx_new = feval (fname, x + delta);
      deriv = (fx_new - fx) / delta;
      x = x - fx / deriv;
      fx = fx_new;
    endif
  endfor

  result = x;

endfunction
</PRE>

<P>
Note that this is only meant to be an example of calling user-supplied
functions and should not be taken too seriously.  In addition to using a
more robust algorithm, any serious code would check the number and type
of all the arguments, ensure that the supplied function really was a
function, etc.  See See section <A HREF="octave_5.html#SEC55">Predicates for Numeric Objects</A>, for example,
for a list of predicates for numeric objects, and See section <A HREF="octave_10.html#SEC69">Status of Variables</A>, for a description of the <CODE>exist</CODE> function.
