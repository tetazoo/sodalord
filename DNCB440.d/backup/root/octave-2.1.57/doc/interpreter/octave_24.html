avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.

<A NAME="IDX849"></A>

</PRE>

<P>
and the initial condition <CODE>x0 = [ 4; 1.1; 4 ]</CODE>, the set of

<PRE>
t = linspace (0, 500, 1000);

<P>
If you try this, you will see that the value of the result changes
dramatically between <VAR>t</VAR> = 0 and 5, and again around <VAR>t</VAR> = 305.
A more efficient set of output points might be

Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.  The test is

A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type of

codes 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>0
<DD>

<DT><U>Loadable Function:</U> [<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>xdot</VAR>, <VAR>t_out</VAR>, <VAR>istat</VAR>, <VAR>msg</VAR>] = <B>dasrt</B> <I>(<VAR>fcn</VAR> [, <VAR>g</VAR>], <VAR>x_0</VAR>, <VAR>xdot_0</VAR>, <VAR>t</VAR> [, <VAR>t_crit</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX854"></A>
Solve the set of differential-algebraic equations



<PRE>
0 = f (xdot, x, t)
</PRE>

<P>
with



<PRE>
x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0
</PRE>

<P>
with functional stopping criteria (root solving).


<P>
The solution is returned in the matrices <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>xdot</VAR>,
with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the
elements in the vector <VAR>t_out</VAR>.  The first element of <VAR>t</VAR>
should be <EM>t_0</EM> and correspond to the initial state of the
system <VAR>x_0</VAR> and its derivative <VAR>xdot_0</VAR>, so that the first
row of the output <VAR>x</VAR> is <VAR>x_0</VAR> and the first row
of the output <VAR>xdot</VAR> is <VAR>xdot_0</VAR>.


<P>
The vector <VAR>t</VAR> provides an upper limit on the length of the
integration.  If the stopping condition is met, the vector
<VAR>t_out</VAR> will be shorter than <VAR>t</VAR>, and the final element of
<VAR>t_out</VAR> will be the point at which the stopping condition was met,
and may not correspond to any element of the vector <VAR>t</VAR>.


<P>
The first argument, <VAR>fcn</VAR>, is a string that names the function to
call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.
It must have the form



<PRE>
<VAR>res</VAR> = f (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>xdot</VAR>, <VAR>t</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
in which <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>xdot</VAR>, and <VAR>res</VAR> are vectors, and <VAR>t</VAR> is a
scalar.


<P>
If <VAR>fcn</VAR> is a two-element string array, the first element names
the function <EM>f</EM> described above, and the second element names
a function to compute the modified Jacobian



<PRE>
      df       df
jac = -- + c ------
      dx     d xdot
</PRE>

<P>
The modified Jacobian function must have the form



<PRE>

<VAR>jac</VAR> = j (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>xdot</VAR>, <VAR>t</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)

</PRE>

<P>
The optional second argument names a function that defines the
constraint functions whose roots are desired during the integration.
This function must have the form



<PRE>
<VAR>g_out</VAR> = g (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>t</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
and return a vector of the constraint function values.
If the value of any of the constraint functions changes sign, DASRT
will attempt to stop the integration at the point of the sign change.


<P>
If the name of the constraint function is omitted, <CODE>dasrt</CODE> solves
the saem problem as <CODE>daspk</CODE> or <CODE>dassl</CODE>.


<P>
Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions
due to roundoff and integration error, DASRT may return false
roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values of
<VAR>T</VAR>.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider
smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of the
constraint functions.


<P>
If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the problem,
the input to DASRT should nevertheless allow integration to a
point slightly past that root, so that DASRT can locate the root
by interpolation.


<P>
The third and fourth arguments to <CODE>dasrt</CODE> specify the initial
condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument
specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired,
including the time corresponding to the initial condition.


<P>
The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to
be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at
determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that
the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.


<P>
The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for
avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a
discontinuity in the derivative.


<P>
After a successful computation, the value of <VAR>istate</VAR> will be
greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).


<P>
If the computation is not successful, the value of <VAR>istate</VAR> will be
less than zero and <VAR>msg</VAR> will contain additional information.


<P>
You can use the function <CODE>dasrt_options</CODE> to set optional
parameters for <CODE>dasrt</CODE>.

When called with two arguments, this function
allows you set options parameters for the function <CODE>dasrt</CODE>.
Given one argument, <CODE>dasrt_options</CODE> returns the value of the
corresponding option.  If no arguments are supplied, the names of all
the available options and their current values are displayed.


<P>
Options include


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>"absolute tolerance"</CODE>
<DD>
Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.
<DT><CODE>"relative tolerance"</CODE>
<DD>
Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

The local error test applied at each integration step is

<PRE>
  abs (local error in x(i)) &#60;= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>"initial step size"</CODE>
<DD>
Differential-algebraic problems may occaisionally suffer from severe
scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal
about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this
problem by specifying an initial stepsize.
<DT><CODE>"maximum order"</CODE>
<DD>
Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must
be between 1 and 5, inclusive.
<DT><CODE>"maximum step size"</CODE>
<DD>
Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large
regions.
<DT><CODE>"step limit"</CODE>
<DD>
Maximum number of integration steps to attempt on a single call to the
underlying Fortran code.
