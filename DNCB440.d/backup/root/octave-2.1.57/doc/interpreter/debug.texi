@chapter Debugging

@anchor{doc-dbstop}
@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {rline =} dbstop (func, line)
Set a breakpoint in a function
@table @code
@item func
String representing the function name.  When already in debug
mode this should be left out and only the line should be given.
@item line
Line you would like the breakpoint to be set on
@end table

The rline returned is the real line that the breakpoint was set at.

@end deftypefn
@seealso{dbclear, dbstatus, dbnext}


@anchor{doc-dbclear}
@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} dbclear (func, line)
Delete a breakpoint in a function
@table @code
@item func
String representing the function name.  When already in debug
mode this should be left out and only the line should be given.
@item line
Line where you would like to remove the the breakpoint
@end table
No checking is done to make sure that the line you requested is really
a breakpoint.   If you get the wrong line nothing will happen.
@end deftypefn
@seealso{dbstop, dbstatus, dbwhere}


@anchor{doc-dbstatus}
@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {lst =} dbstatus ([func])
Return a vector containing the lines on which a function has 
breakpoints set.
@table @code
@item func
String representing the function name.  When already in debug
mode this should be left out.
@end table
@end deftypefn
@seealso{dbclear, dbwhere}


@anchor{doc-dbwhere}
@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} dbwhere ()
Show where we are in the code
@end deftypefn
@seealso{dbclear, dbstatus, dbstop}


@anchor{doc-dbtype}
@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} dbtype ()
List script file with line numbers.
@end deftypefn
@seealso{dbclear, dbstatus, dbstop}


@anchor{doc-debug_on_interrupt}
@defvr {Built-in Variable} debug_on_interrupt
If @code{debug_on_interrupt} is nonzero, Octave will try to enter
debugging mode when it receives an interrupt signal (typically
generated with @kbd{C-c}).  If a second interrupt signal is received
before reaching the debugging mode, a normal interrupt will occur.
The default value is 0.
@end defvr


@anchor{doc-debug_on_warning}
@defvr {Built-in Variable} debug_on_warning
If the value of @code{debug_on_warning} is nonzero, Octave will try
to enter the debugger when a warning is encountered.  The default
value is 0.
@end defvr


@anchor{doc-debug_on_error}
@defvr {Built-in Variable} debug_on_error
If the value of @code{debug_on_error} is nonzero, Octave will try
to enter the debugger when an error is encountered.  This will also
inhibit printing of the normal traceback message (you will only see
the top-level error message).  The default value is 0.
@end defvr
