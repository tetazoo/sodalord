@chapter Plotting

All of Octave's plotting functions use @code{gnuplot} to handle the
actual graphics.  There are two low-level functions, @code{gplot} and
@code{gsplot}, that behave almost exactly like the corresponding
@code{gnuplot} functions @code{plot} and @code{splot}.  A number of
other higher level plotting functions, patterned after the graphics
functions found in @sc{Matlab} version 3.5, are also available.
These higher level functions are all implemented in terms of the two
low-level plotting functions.

@section Two-Dimensional Plotting

@deffn {Command} gplot @var{ranges} @var{expression} @var{using} @var{title} @var{style}
Generate a 2-dimensional plot.

The @var{ranges}, @var{using}, @var{title}, and @var{style} arguments
are optional, and the @var{using}, @var{title} and @var{style}
qualifiers may appear in any order after the expression.  You may plot
multiple expressions with a single command by separating them with
commas.  Each expression may have its own set of qualifiers.

The optional item @var{ranges} has the syntax

@example
[ x_lo : x_up ] [ y_lo : y_up ]
@end example

@noindent
and may be used to specify the ranges for the axes of the plot,
independent of the actual range of the data.  The range for the y axes
and any of the individual limits may be omitted.  A range @code{[:]}
indicates that the default limits should be used.  This normally means
that a range just large enough to include all the data points will be
used.

The expression to be plotted must not contain any literal matrices
(e.g. @code{[ 1, 2; 3, 4 ]}) since it is nearly impossible to
distinguish a plot range from a matrix of data.

See the help for @code{gnuplot} for a description of the syntax for the
optional items.

By default, the @code{gplot} command plots the second column of a matrix
versus the first.  If the matrix only has one column, it is taken as a
vector of y-coordinates and the x-coordinate is taken as the element
index, starting with zero.  For example,

@example
gplot rand (100,1) with linespoints
@end example

@noindent
will plot 100 random values and connect them with lines.  When
@code{gplot} is used to plot a column vector, the indices of the
elements are taken as x values.

  If there are more than two columns, you can
choose which columns to plot with the @var{using} qualifier. For
example, given the data

@example
x = (-10:0.1:10)';
data = [x, sin(x), cos(x)];
@end example

@noindent
the command

@example
gplot [-11:11] [-1.1:1.1] \
  data with lines, data using 1:3 with impulses
@end example

@noindent
will plot two lines.  The first line is generated by the command
@code{data with lines}, and is a graph of the sine function over the
range @minus{}10 to 10.  The data is taken from the first two columns of
the matrix because columns to plot were not specified with the
@var{using} qualifier.

The clause @code{using 1:3} in the second part of this plot command
specifies that the first and third columns of the matrix @code{data}
should be taken as the values to plot.

In this example, the ranges have been explicitly specified to be a bit
larger than the actual range of the data so that the curves do not touch
the border of the plot.
@end deffn

@deffn {Command} gset options
@deffnx {Command} gshow options
@deffnx {Command} replot options
In addition to the basic plotting commands, the whole range of
@code{gset} and @code{gshow} commands from @code{gnuplot} are available,
as is @code{replot}.

@findex set
@findex show
Note that in Octave 2.0, the @code{set} and @code{show} commands were
renamed to @code{gset} and @code{gshow} in order to allow for
compatibility with the @sc{Matlab} graphics and GUI commands in a future
version of Octave.  (For now, the old @code{set} and @code{show}
commands do work, but they print an annoying warning message to try to
get people to switch to using @code{gset} and @code{gshow}.)

The @code{gset} and @code{gshow} commands allow you to set and show
@code{gnuplot} parameters.  For more information about the @code{gset}
and @code{gshow} commands, see the documentation for @code{set} and
@code{show} in the @code{gnuplot} user's guide (also available on line
if you run @code{gnuplot} directly, instead of running it from Octave).

The @code{replot} command allows you to force the plot to be
redisplayed.  This is useful if you have changed something about the
plot, such as the title or axis labels.  The @code{replot} command also
accepts the same arguments as @code{gplot} or @code{gsplot} (except for
data ranges) so you can add additional lines to existing plots.  

For example,

@example
gset term tek40
gset output "/dev/plotter"
gset title "sine with lines and cosine with impulses"
replot "sin (x) w l"
@end example

will change the terminal type for plotting, add a title to the current
plot, add a graph of
@iftex
@tex
$\sin(x)$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
sin (x) 
@end ifinfo
to the plot, and force the new plot to be
sent to the plot device.  This last step is normally required in order
to update the plot.  This default is reasonable for slow terminals or
hardcopy output devices because even when you are adding additional
lines with a replot command, gnuplot always redraws the entire plot, and
you probably don't want to have a completely new plot generated every
time something as minor as an axis label changes.

@findex shg
The command @code{shg} is equivalent to executing @code{replot} without
any arguments.
@end deffn

@anchor{doc-automatic_replot}
@defvr {Built-in Variable} automatic_replot
You can tell Octave to redisplay the plot each time anything about it
changes by setting the value of the builtin variable
@code{automatic_replot} to a nonzero value.  Although it is fairly
inefficient, especially for large plots, the default value is 1 for
compatibility with Matlab.
@end defvr


Note that NaN values in the plot data are automatically omitted, and
Inf values are converted to a very large value before calling gnuplot.

The @sc{Matlab}-style two-dimensional plotting commands are:

@cindex plotting
@cindex graphics

@anchor{doc-plot}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} plot (@var{args})
This function produces two-dimensional plots.  Many different
combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

@example
plot (@var{y})
@end example

@noindent
where the argument is taken as the set of @var{y} coordinates and the
@var{x} coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements,
starting with 1.

If more than one argument is given, they are interpreted as

@example
plot (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{fmt} ...)
@end example

@noindent
where @var{y} and @var{fmt} are optional, and any number of argument
sets may appear.  The @var{x} and @var{y} values are
interpreted as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of @var{y}
coordinates and the @var{x} coordinates are taken to be the indices of
the elements, starting with 1.

@item
If the first argument is a vector and the second is a matrix, the
the vector is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of the matrix.
(using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

@item
If the first argument is a matrix and the second is a vector, the
the columns (or rows) of the matrix are plotted versus the vector.
(using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

@item
If both arguments are vectors, the elements of @var{y} are plotted versus
the elements of @var{x}.

@item
If both arguments are matrices, the columns of @var{y} are plotted
versus the columns of @var{x}.  In this case, both matrices must have
the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose
the arguments to make the number of rows match.

If both arguments are scalars, a single point is plotted.
@end itemize

If the @var{fmt} argument is supplied, it is interpreted as
follows.  If @var{fmt} is missing, the default gnuplot line style
is assumed.

@table @samp
@item -
Set lines plot style (default).

@item .
Set dots plot style.

@item @@
Set points plot style.

@item -@@
Set linespoints plot style.

@item ^
Set impulses plot style.

@item L
Set steps plot style.

@item @var{n}
Interpreted as the plot color if @var{n} is an integer in the range 1 to
6.

@item @var{nm}
If @var{nm} is a two digit integer and @var{m} is an integer in the
range 1 to 6, @var{m} is interpreted as the point style.  This is only
valid in combination with the @code{@@} or @code{-@@} specifiers.

@item @var{c}
If @var{c} is one of @code{"r"}, @code{"g"}, @code{"b"}, @code{"m"},
@code{"c"}, or @code{"w"}, it is interpreted as the plot color (red,
green, blue, magenta, cyan, or white).

@item ";title;"
Here @code{"title"} is the label for the key.

@item +
@itemx *
@itemx o
@itemx x
Used in combination with the points or linespoints styles, set the point
style.
@end table

The color line styles have the following meanings on terminals that
support color.

@example
Number  Gnuplot colors  (lines)points style
  1       red                   *
  2       green                 +
  3       blue                  o
  4       magenta               x
  5       cyan                house
  6       brown            there exists
@end example

The @var{fmt} argument can also be used to assign key titles.
To do so, include the desired title between semi-colons after the
formatting sequence described above, e.g. "+3;Key Title;"
Note that the last semi-colon is required and will generate an error if
it is left out.

Here are some plot examples:

@example
plot (x, y, "@@12", x, y2, x, y3, "4", x, y4, "+")
@end example

This command will plot @code{y} with points of type 2 (displayed as
@samp{+}) and color 1 (red), @code{y2} with lines, @code{y3} with lines of
color 4 (magenta) and @code{y4} with points displayed as @samp{+}.

@example
plot (b, "*")
@end example

This command will plot the data in the variable @code{b} will be plotted
with points displayed as @samp{*}.

@example
t = 0:0.1:6.3;
plot (t, cos(t), "-;cos(t);", t, sin(t), "+3;sin(t);");
@end example

This will plot the cosine and sine functions and label them accordingly
in the key.

@anchor{doc-hold}
@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} hold @var{args}
Tell Octave to `hold' the current data on the plot when executing
subsequent plotting commands.  This allows you to execute a series of
plot commands and have all the lines end up on the same figure.  The
default is for each new plot command to clear the plot device first.
For example, the command

@example
hold on
@end example

@noindent
turns the hold state on.  An argument of @code{off} turns the hold state
off, and @code{hold} with no arguments toggles the current hold state.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-ishold}
@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} ishold
Return 1 if the next line will be added to the current plot, or 0 if
the plot device will be cleared before drawing the next line.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-clearplot}
@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} clearplot
@deftypefnx {Built-in Function} {} clg
Clear the plot window and any titles or axis labels.  The name
@code{clg} is aliased to @code{clearplot} for compatibility with
@sc{Matlab}.

The commands @kbd{gplot clear}, @kbd{gsplot clear}, and @kbd{replot
clear} are equivalent to @code{clearplot}.  (Previously, commands like
@kbd{gplot clear} would evaluate @code{clear} as an ordinary expression
and clear all the visible variables.)
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-shg}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} shg

Show the graph window.  Currently, this is the same as executing
replot without any arguments.

@end deftypefn
@seealso{plot, semilogx, semilogy, loglog, polar, mesh, contour,
bar, stairs, gplot, gsplot, replot, xlabel, and ylabel}


@anchor{doc-closeplot}
@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} closeplot
Close stream to the @code{gnuplot} subprocess.  If you are using X11,
this will close the plot window.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-purge_tmp_files}
@deftypefn {Built-in Function} {} purge_tmp_files
Delete the temporary files created by the plotting commands.

Octave creates temporary data files for @code{gnuplot} and then sends
commands to @code{gnuplot} through a pipe.  Octave will delete the
temporary files on exit, but if you are doing a lot of plotting you may
want to clean up in the middle of a session.

A future version of Octave will eliminate the need to use temporary
files to hold the plot data.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-axis}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} axis (@var{limits})
Set axis limits for plots.

The argument @var{limits} should be a 2, 4, or 6 element vector.  The
first and second elements specify the lower and upper limits for the x
axis.  The third and fourth specify the limits for the y axis, and the
fifth and sixth specify the limits for the z axis.

If your plot is already drawn, then you need to use @code{replot} before
the new axis limits will take effect.  You can get this to happen
automatically by setting the built-in variable @code{automatic_replot}
to a nonzero value.

Without any arguments, @code{axis} turns autoscaling on.

The vector argument specifying limits is optional, and additional
string arguments may be used to specify various axis properties.  For
example,

@example
axis ([1, 2, 3, 4], "square");
@end example

@noindent
forces a square aspect ratio, and

@example
axis ("labely", "tic");
@end example

@noindent
turns tic marks on for all axes and tic mark labels on for the y-axis
only.

@noindent
The following options control the aspect ratio of the axes.

@table @code
@item "square"
Force a square aspect ratio.
@item "equal"
Force x distance to equal y-distance.
@item "normal"
Restore the balance.
@end table

@noindent
The following options control the way axis limits are interpreted.

@table @code
@item "auto" 
Set the specified axes to have nice limits around the data
or all if no axes are specified.
@item "manual" 
Fix the current axes limits.
@item "tight"
Fix axes to the limits of the data (not implemented).
@end table

@noindent
The option @code{"image"} is equivalent to @code{"tight"} and
@code{"equal"}.

@noindent
The following options affect the appearance of tic marks.

@table @code
@item "on" 
Turn tic marks and labels on for all axes.
@item "off"
Turn tic marks off for all axes.
@item "tic[xyz]"
Turn tic marks on for all axes, or turn them on for the
specified axes and off for the remainder.
@item "label[xyz]"
Turn tic labels on for all axes, or turn them on for the 
specified axes and off for the remainder.
@item "nolabel"
Turn tic labels off for all axes.
@end table
Note, if there are no tic marks for an axis, there can be no labels.

@noindent
The following options affect the direction of increasing values on
the axes.

@table @code
@item "ij"
Reverse y-axis, so lower values are nearer the top.
@item "xy" 
Restore y-axis, so higher values are nearer the top. 
@end table

@anchor{doc-bar}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} bar (@var{x}, @var{y})
Given two vectors of x-y data, @code{bar} produces a bar graph.

If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of y-values
and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements.

If two output arguments are specified, the data are generated but
not plotted.  For example,

@example

@anchor{doc-hist}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} hist (@var{y}, @var{x}, @var{norm})
Produce histogram counts or plots.

With one vector input argument, plot a histogram of the values with
10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range
of the data.

Given a second scalar argument, use that as the number of bins.

Given a second vector argument, use that as the centers of the bins,
with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent values in
the vector.

If third argument is provided, the histogram is normalised such that
the sum of the bars is equal to @var{norm}.

Extreme values are lumped in the first and last bins.

With two output arguments, produce the values @var{nn} and @var{xx} such
that @code{bar (@var{xx}, @var{nn})} will plot the histogram.

Given two vectors of x-y data, bar produces a `stairstep' plot.

If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of y-values
and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements.

If two output arguments are specified, the data are generated but
not plotted.  For example,

@example
stairs (x, y);

@anchor{doc-errorbar}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} errorbar (@var{args})
This function produces two-dimensional plots with errorbars. Many
different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

@example
errorbar (@var{y}, @var{ey})
@end example

@noindent
where the first argument is taken as the set of @var{y} coordinates
and the second argument @var{ey} is taken as the errors of the
@var{y} values. @var{x} coordinates are taken to be the indices
of the elements, starting with 1.

If more than two arguments are given, they are interpreted as

@example
errorbar (@var{x}, @var{y}, ..., @var{fmt} ...)
@end example

@noindent
where after @var{x} and @var{y} there can be up to four error
parameters such as @var{ey}, @var{ex}, @var{ly}, @var{uy} etc.,
depending on the plot type. Any number of argument sets may appear,
as long as they are separated with a format string @var{fmt}.

If @var{y} is a matrix, @var{x} and error parameters must also be matrices
having same dimensions. The columns of @var{y} are plotted versus the
corresponding columns of @var{x} and errorbars are drawn from
the corresponding columns of error parameters.

If @var{fmt} is missing, yerrorbars ("~") plot style
is assumed.
If the @var{fmt} argument is supplied, it is interpreted as in
normal plots (See __pltopt__). In addition the following
plot styles are supported by errorbar:

@table @samp
@item ~
Set yerrorbars plot style (default).

@item >

qualifiers may appear in any order after the expression.  You may plot
multiple expressions with a single command by separating them with
commas.  Each expression may have its own set of qualifiers.

The optional item @var{ranges} has the syntax

@example
[ x_lo : x_up ] [ y_lo : y_up ] [ z_lo : z_up ]
@end example

@noindent
and may be used to specify the ranges for the axes of the plot,
independent of the actual range of the data.  The range for the y and z
axes and any of the individual limits may be omitted.  A range
@code{[:]} indicates that the default limits should be used.  This
normally means that a range just large enough to include all the data
points will be used.

The expression to be plotted must not contain any literal matrices (e.g.
@code{[ 1, 2; 3, 4 ]}) since it is nearly impossible to distinguish a
plot range from a matrix of data.

See the help for @code{gnuplot} for a description of the syntax for the
optional items.

By default, the @code{gsplot} command plots each column of the
expression as the z value, using the row index as the x value, and the
column index as the y value.  The indices are counted from zero, not
one.  For example,

@example
gsplot rand (5, 2)
@end example

@noindent
will plot a random surface, with the x and y values taken from the row
and column indices of the matrix.

If parametric plotting mode is set (using the command
@kbd{gset parametric}, then @code{gsplot} takes the columns of the
matrix three at a time as the x, y and z values that define a line in
three space.  Any extra columns are ignored, and the x and y values are
expected to be sorted.  For example, with @code{parametric} set, it
makes sense to plot a matrix like
@iftex
@tex
$$
\left[\matrix{
1 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 9 \cr
1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 2 & 8 \cr
1 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 7}\right]
$$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo

@example
1 1 3 2 1 6 3 1 9
1 2 2 2 2 5 3 2 8
1 3 1 2 3 4 3 3 7
@end example
@end ifinfo

@noindent
but not @code{rand (5, 30)}.
@end deffn

The @sc{Matlab}-style three-dimensional plotting commands are:

@anchor{doc-mesh}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} mesh (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{z})
Plot a mesh given matrices @var{x}, and @var{y} from @code{meshdom} and
a matrix @var{z} corresponding to the @var{x} and @var{y} coordinates of
the mesh.  If @var{x} and @var{y} are vectors, then a typical vertex
is (@var{x}(j), @var{y}(i), @var{z}(i,j)).  Thus, columns of @var{z}
correspond to different @var{x} values and rows of @var{z} correspond
to different @var{y} values.
@end deftypefn
@seealso{plot, semilogx, semilogy, loglog, polar, meshgrid, meshdom,

@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{xx}, @var{yy}] =} meshgrid (@var{x})
Given vectors of @var{x} and @var{y} coordinates, return two matrices corresponding
to the @var{x} and @var{y} coordinates of a mesh.  The rows of @var{xx} are copies of @var{x},
and the columns of @var{yy} are copies of @var{y}.

@deftypefn {Function File} {} meshdom (@var{x}, @var{y})
Given vectors of @var{x} and @var{y} coordinates, return two matrices
corresponding to the @var{x} and @var{y} coordinates of the mesh.

Note: this function is provided for compatibility with older versions
of @sc{Matlab}.  You should use @code{meshgrid} instead.
@end deftypefn


@node Plot Annotations
@section Plot Annotations

@anchor{doc-grid}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} grid (@var{arg})
For two-dimensional plotting, force the display of a grid on the plot.
The argument may be either @code{"on"} or @code{"off"}.  If it is
omitted, @code{"on"} is assumed.

@node Multiple Plots on One Page
@section Multiple Plots on One Page

The following functions all require a version of @code{gnuplot} that
supports the multiplot feature.

@anchor{doc-mplot}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} mplot (@var{x}, @var{y})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} mplot (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{fmt})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} mplot (@var{x1}, @var{y1}, @var{x2}, @var{y2})
This is a modified version of the @code{plot} function that works with
the multiplot version of @code{gnuplot} to plot multiple plots per page.
This plot version automatically advances to the next subplot position
after each set of arguments are processed.

See the description of the @var{plot} function for the various options.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-multiplot}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} multiplot (@var{xn}, @var{yn})
Sets and resets multiplot mode.

If the arguments are non-zero, @code{multiplot} will set up multiplot
mode with @var{xn}, @var{yn} subplots along the @var{x} and @var{y}
axes.  If both arguments are zero, @code{multiplot} closes multiplot
mode.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-oneplot}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} oneplot ()
If in multiplot mode, switches to single plot mode.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-plot_border}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} plot_border (...)
Multiple arguments allowed to specify the sides on which the border
is shown.  Allowed arguments include:

@table @code
@item "blank"
No borders displayed.

@item "all"
All borders displayed

@item "north"
North Border

@item "south"
South Border

@item "east"
East Border

@item "west"
West Border
@end table

@noindent
The arguments may be abbreviated to single characters.  Without any
arguments, @code{plot_border} turns borders off.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-subplot}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} subplot (@var{rows}, @var{cols}, @var{index})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} subplot (@var{rcn})
Sets @code{gnuplot} in multiplot mode and plots in location
given by index (there are @var{cols} by @var{rows} subwindows).

The global variable @var{__multiplot_scale__} should be used when the
command @code{gset size xsize, ysize} has been used prior to calling
@code{subplot}.

The value of @var{__multiplot_scale__} should be a vector with two
elements, the first set equal to @var{xsize} and the second to
@var{ysize}.

Input:

@table @var
@item rows
Number of rows in subplot grid.

@item columns
Number of columns in subplot grid.

@item index
Index of subplot where to make the next plot.
@end table

If only one argument is supplied, then it must be a three digit value
specifying the location in digits 1 (rows) and 2 (columns) and the plot
index in digit 3.

The plot index runs row-wise.  First all the columns in a row are filled
and then the next row is filled.

For example, a plot with 4 by 2 grid will have plot indices running as
follows:
@iftex
@tex
\vskip 10pt
\hfil\vbox{\offinterlineskip\hrule
\halign{\vrule#&&\qquad\hfil#\hfil\qquad\vrule\cr
height13pt&1&2&3&4\cr height12pt&&&&\cr\noalign{\hrule}
height13pt&5&6&7&8\cr height12pt&&&&\cr\noalign{\hrule}}}
\hfil

@end group
@end display
@end ifinfo
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-subwindow}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} subwindow (@var{xn}, @var{yn})
Sets the subwindow position in multiplot mode for the next plot.  The
multiplot mode has to be previously initialized using the
@code{multiplot} function, otherwise this command just becomes an alias
to @code{multiplot}
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-top_title}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} top_title (@var{string})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} bottom_title (@var{string})
Makes a title with text @var{string} at the top (bottom) of the plot.
@end deftypefn


@node Multiple Plot Windows
@section Multiple Plot Windows

@anchor{doc-figure}
