<H1>GNU Octave</H1>

<P>The <SAMP>`#!'</SAMP>
mechanism works on Unix systems derived from Berkeley Unix, System V
Release 4, and some System V Release 3 systems.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="octave_11.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>Some of Octave's function are
implemented in terms of functions that cannot be called recursively.
For example, the ODE solver <CODE>lsode</CODE> is ultimately implemented in a
Fortran subroutine that cannot be called recursively, so <CODE>lsode</CODE>
should not be called either directly or indirectly from within the
user-supplied function that <CODE>lsode</CODE> requires.  Doing so will result
in undefined behavior.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="octave_11.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>It would be
much better to use <CODE>prod (1:n)</CODE>, or <CODE>gamma (n+1)</CODE> instead,
after first checking to ensure that the value <CODE>n</CODE> is actually a
positive integer.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="octave_14.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>The <SAMP>`.m'</SAMP> suffix was
chosen for compatibility with MATLAB.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="octave_19.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>For example, to first sort
based on the values in column 1, and then, for any values that are
repeated in column 1, sort based on the values found in column 2, etc.
