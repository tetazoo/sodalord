@node Image Processing
@chapter Image Processing

Octave can display images with the X Window System using the
@code{xloadimage} program.  You do not need to be running X in order to
manipulate images, however, so some of these functions may be useful
even if you are not able to view the results.

Loading images only works with Octave's image format (a file with a
matrix containing the image data, and a matrix containing the
colormap).  Contributions of robust, well-written functions to read
other image formats are welcome.  If you can provide them, or would like
to improve Octave's image processing capabilities in other ways, please
contact @email{bug-octave@@bevo.che.wisc.edu}.
