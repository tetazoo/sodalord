@chapter Quaternions

Quaternions are hypercomplex numbers used to represent spatial
rotations in three dimensions.  This set of routines provides a useful
basis for working with quaternions in Octave.  A tutorial is in the
Octave source, scripts/quaternion/quaternion.ps.

These functions were written by A. S. Hodel, Associate Professor,
Auburn University.
