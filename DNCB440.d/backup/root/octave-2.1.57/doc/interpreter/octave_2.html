<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC5">A Brief Introduction to Octave</A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>


<P>
This manual documents how to run, install and port GNU Octave, and how
to report bugs.


<P>
GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
other numerical experiments.  It may also be used as a batch-oriented
language.


<P>
GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software.  You may
redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.  The GPL is
included in this manual in section <A HREF="octave_41.html#SEC238">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</A>.


<P>
This document corresponds to Octave version 2.1.x.




<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC6">Running Octave</A></H2>

<P>
On most systems, the way to invoke Octave is with the shell command
<SAMP>`octave'</SAMP>.  Octave displays an initial message and then a prompt
indicating it is ready to accept input.  You can begin typing Octave
commands immediately afterward.


<P>
If you get into trouble, you can usually interrupt Octave by typing
<KBD>Control-C</KBD> (usually written <KBD>C-c</KBD> for short).  <KBD>C-c</KBD> gets
its name from the fact that you type it by holding down <KBD>CTRL</KBD> and
then pressing <KBD>c</KBD>.  Doing this will normally return you to Octave's
prompt.


<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
To exit Octave, type <KBD>quit</KBD>, or <KBD>exit</KBD> at the Octave prompt.


<P>
On systems that support job control, you can suspend Octave by sending
it a <CODE>SIGTSTP</CODE> signal, usually by typing <KBD>C-z</KBD>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC7">Simple Examples</A></H2>

<P>
The following chapters describe all of Octave's features in detail, but
before doing that, it might be helpful to give a sampling of some of its
capabilities.


<P>
If you are new to Octave, I recommend that you try these examples to
begin learning Octave by using it.  Lines marked with <SAMP>`octave:13&#62;'</SAMP>
are lines you type, ending each with a carriage return.  Octave will
respond with an answer, or by displaying a graph.




<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC8">Creating a Matrix</A></H3>

<P>
To create a new matrix and store it in a variable so that it you can
refer to it later, type the command



<PRE>
octave:1&#62; a = [ 1, 1, 2; 3, 5, 8; 13, 21, 34 ]
</PRE>

<P>
Octave will respond by printing the matrix in neatly aligned columns.
Ending a command with a semicolon tells Octave to not print the result
of a command.  For example



<PRE>
octave:2&#62; b = rand (3, 2);
</PRE>

<P>
will create a 3 row, 2 column matrix with each element set to a random
value between zero and one.


<P>
To display the value of any variable, simply type the name of the
variable.  For example, to display the value stored in the matrix
<CODE>b</CODE>, type the command



<PRE>
octave:3&#62; b
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC9">Matrix Arithmetic</A></H3>

<P>
Octave has a convenient operator notation for performing matrix
arithmetic.  For example, to multiply the matrix <CODE>a</CODE> by a scalar
value, type the command



<PRE>
octave:4&#62; 2 * a
</PRE>

<P>
To multiply the two matrices <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>b</CODE>, type the command



<PRE>
octave:5&#62; a * b
</PRE>

<P>
To form the matrix product
<CODE>transpose (a) * a</CODE>,
type the command



<PRE>
octave:6&#62; a' * a
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC10">Solving Linear Equations</A></H3>

<P>
To solve the set of linear equations <CODE>a<VAR>x</VAR> = b</CODE>,
use the left division operator, <SAMP>`\'</SAMP>:



<PRE>
octave:7&#62; a \ b
</PRE>

<P>
This is conceptually equivalent to
<CODE>inv (a) * b</CODE>,
but avoids computing the inverse of a matrix directly.


<P>
If the coefficient matrix is singular, Octave will print a warning
message and compute a minimum norm solution.




<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC11">Integrating Differential Equations</A></H3>

<P>
Octave has built-in functions for solving nonlinear differential
equations of the form



<PRE>
dx
-- = f (x, t)
dt
</PRE>

<P>
with the initial condition



<PRE>
x(t = t0) = x0
</PRE>

<P>
For Octave to integrate equations of this form, you must first provide a
definition of the function
<CODE>f(x,t)</CODE>.
This is straightforward, and may be accomplished by entering the
function body directly on the command line.  For example, the following
commands define the right hand side function for an interesting pair of
nonlinear differential equations.  Note that while you are entering a
function, Octave responds with a different prompt, to indicate that it
is waiting for you to complete your input.



<PRE>
octave:8&#62; function xdot = f (x, t) 
&#62;
&#62;  r = 0.25;
&#62;  k = 1.4;
&#62;  a = 1.5;
&#62;  b = 0.16;
&#62;  c = 0.9;
&#62;  d = 0.8;
&#62;
&#62;  xdot(1) = r*x(1)*(1 - x(1)/k) - a*x(1)*x(2)/(1 + b*x(1));
&#62;  xdot(2) = c*a*x(1)*x(2)/(1 + b*x(1)) - d*x(2);
&#62;
&#62; endfunction
</PRE>

<P>
Given the initial condition



<PRE>
x0 = [1; 2];
</PRE>

<P>
and the set of output times as a column vector (note that the first
output time corresponds to the initial condition given above)



<PRE>
t = linspace (0, 50, 200)';
</PRE>

<P>
it is easy to integrate the set of differential equations:



<PRE>
x = lsode ("f", x0, t);
</PRE>

<P>
The function <CODE>lsode</CODE> uses the Livermore Solver for Ordinary
Differential Equations, described in A. C. Hindmarsh, <CITE>ODEPACK, a
Systematized Collection of ODE Solvers</CITE>, in: Scientific Computing, R. S.
Stepleman et al. (Eds.), North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1983, pages 55--64.




<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC12">Producing Graphical Output</A></H3>

<P>
To display the solution of the previous example graphically, use the
command



<PRE>
plot (t, x)
</PRE>

<P>
If you are using the X Window System, Octave will automatically create
a separate window to display the plot.  If you are using a terminal that
supports some other graphics commands, you will need to tell Octave what
kind of terminal you have.  Type the command



<PRE>
gset term
</PRE>

<P>
to see a list of the supported terminal types.  Octave uses
<CODE>gnuplot</CODE> to display graphics, and can display graphics on any
terminal that is supported by <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>.


<P>
To capture the output of the plot command in a file rather than sending
the output directly to your terminal, you can use a set of commands like
this



<PRE>
gset term postscript
gset output "foo.ps"
replot
</PRE>

<P>
This will work for other types of output devices as well.  Octave's
<CODE>gset</CODE> command is really just piped to the <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>
subprocess, so that once you have a plot on the screen that you like,
you should be able to do something like this to create an output file
suitable for your graphics printer.


<P>
Or, you can eliminate the intermediate file by using commands like this



<PRE>
gset term postscript
gset output "|lpr -Pname_of_your_graphics_printer"
replot
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC13">Editing What You Have Typed</A></H3>

<P>
At the Octave prompt, you can recall, edit, and reissue previous
commands using Emacs- or vi-style editing commands.  The default
keybindings use Emacs-style commands.  For example, to recall the
previous command, type <KBD>Control-p</KBD> (usually written <KBD>C-p</KBD> for
short).  <KBD>C-p</KBD> gets its name from the fact that you type it by
holding down <KBD>CTRL</KBD> and then pressing <KBD>p</KBD>.  Doing this will
normally bring back the previous line of input.  <KBD>C-n</KBD> will bring up
the next line of input, <KBD>C-b</KBD> will move the cursor backward on the
line, <KBD>C-f</KBD> will move the cursor forward on the line, etc.


<P>
A complete description of the command line editing capability is given
in this manual in section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC30">Command Line Editing</A>.




<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC14">Help and Documentation</A></H3>

<P>
Octave has an extensive help facility.  The same documentation that is
available in printed form is also available from the Octave prompt,
because both forms of the documentation are created from the same input
file.


<P>
In order to get good help you first need to know the name of the command
that you want to use.  This name of the function may not always be
obvious, but a good place to start is to just type <CODE>help</CODE>.
This will show you all the operators, reserved words, functions,
built-in variables, and function files.  You can then get more
help on anything that is listed by simply including the name as an
argument to help.  For example,



<PRE>
help plot
</PRE>

<P>
will display the help text for the <CODE>plot</CODE> function.


<P>
Octave sends output that is too long to fit on one screen through a
pager like <CODE>less</CODE> or <CODE>more</CODE>.  Type a <KBD>RET</KBD> to advance one
line, a <KBD>SPC</KBD> to advance one page, and <KBD>q</KBD> to exit the pager.


<P>
The part of Octave's help facility that allows you to read the complete
text of the printed manual from within Octave normally uses a separate
program called Info.  When you invoke Info you will be put into a menu
driven program that contains the entire Octave manual.  Help for using
Info is provided in this manual in section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC29">Commands for Getting Help</A>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC15">Conventions</A></H2>

<P>
This section explains the notational conventions that are used in this
manual.  You may want to skip this section and refer back to it later.




<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC16">Fonts</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>


<P>
Examples of Octave code appear in this font or form: <CODE>svd (a)</CODE>.
Names that represent arguments or metasyntactic variables appear
in this font or form: <VAR>first-number</VAR>.  Commands that you type at the
shell prompt sometimes appear in this font or form:
<SAMP>`octave --no-init-file'</SAMP>.  Commands that you type at the Octave
prompt sometimes appear in this font or form: <KBD>foo --bar --baz</KBD>.
Specific keys on your keyboard appear in this font or form: <KBD>ANY</KBD>.
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>




<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC17">Evaluation Notation</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>


<P>
In the examples in this manual, results from expressions that you
evaluate are indicated with <SAMP>`=>'</SAMP>.  For example,



<PRE>
sqrt (2)
     => 1.4142
</PRE>

<P>
You can read this as "<CODE>sqrt (2)</CODE> evaluates to 1.4142".


<P>
In some cases, matrix values that are returned by expressions are
displayed like this



<PRE>
[1, 2; 3, 4] == [1, 3; 2, 4]
     => [ 1, 0; 0, 1 ]
</PRE>

<P>
and in other cases, they are displayed like this



<PRE>
eye (3)
     =>  1  0  0
         0  1  0
         0  0  1
</PRE>

<P>
in order to clearly show the structure of the result.


<P>
Sometimes to help describe one expression, another expression is
shown that produces identical results.  The exact equivalence of
expressions is indicated with <SAMP>`=='</SAMP>.  For example,



<PRE>
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], -1)
==
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 3)
==
rot90 ([1, 2; 3, 4], 7)
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC18">Printing Notation</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>


<P>
Many of the examples in this manual print text when they are
evaluated.  Examples in this manual indicate printed text with
<SAMP>`-|'</SAMP>.  The value that is returned by evaluating the
expression (here <CODE>1</CODE>) is displayed with <SAMP>`=>'</SAMP> and
follows on a separate line.



<PRE>
printf ("foo %s\n", "bar")
     -| foo bar
     => 1
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC19">Error Messages</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>


<P>
Some examples signal errors.  This normally displays an error message
on your terminal.  Error messages are shown on a line starting with
<CODE>error:</CODE>.



<PRE>
struct_elements ([1, 2; 3, 4])
error: struct_elements: wrong type argument `matrix'
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC20">Format of Descriptions</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>


<P>
Functions, commands, and variables are described in this manual in a 
uniform format.  The first line of a description contains the name of
the item followed by its arguments, if any.
The category--function, variable, or whatever--appears at the
beginning of the line.
The description follows on succeeding lines, sometimes with examples.




<H4><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC21">A Sample Function Description</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>


<P>
In a function description, the name of the function being described
appears first.  It is followed on the same line by a list of parameters.
The names used for the parameters are also used in the body of the
description.


<P>
Here is a description of an imaginary function <CODE>foo</CODE>:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U>  <B>foo</B> <I>(<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>y</VAR>, ...)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX18"></A>
The function <CODE>foo</CODE> subtracts <VAR>x</VAR> from <VAR>y</VAR>, then adds the
remaining arguments to the result.  If <VAR>y</VAR> is not supplied, then the
number 19 is used by default.



<PRE>
foo (1, [3, 5], 3, 9)
     => [ 14, 16 ]
foo (5)
     => 14
</PRE>

<P>
More generally,



<PRE>
foo (<VAR>w</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>y</VAR>, ...)
==
<VAR>x</VAR> - <VAR>w</VAR> + <VAR>y</VAR> + ...
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
Any parameter whose name contains the name of a type (e.g.,
<VAR>integer</VAR>, <VAR>integer1</VAR> or <VAR>matrix</VAR>) is expected to be of that
type.  Parameters named <VAR>object</VAR> may be of any type.  Parameters
with other sorts of names (e.g., <VAR>new_file</VAR>) are discussed
specifically in the description of the function.  In some sections,
features common to parameters of several functions are described at the
beginning.


<P>
Functions in Octave may be defined in several different ways.  The
catagory name for functions may include another name that indicates the
way that the function is defined.  These additional tags include


<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Built-in Function
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
The function described is written in a language like C++, C, or Fortran,
and is part of the compiled Octave binary.

<DT>Loadable Function
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
The function described is written in a language like C++, C, or Fortran.
On systems that support dynamic linking of user-supplied functions, it
may be automatically linked while Octave is running, but only if it is
needed.  See section <A HREF="octave_14.html#SEC106">Dynamically Linked Functions</A>.

<DT>Function File
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
The function described is defined using Octave commands stored in a text
file.  See section <A HREF="octave_14.html#SEC104">Function Files</A>.

<DT>Mapping Function
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
The function described works element-by-element for matrix and vector
arguments.
</DL>



<H4><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC22">A Sample Command Description</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>


<P>
Command descriptions have a format similar to function descriptions,
except that the word `Function' is replaced by `Command.  Commands are
functions that may called without surrounding their arguments in
parentheses.  For example, here is the description for Octave's
<CODE>cd</CODE> command:


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>cd</B> <I>dir</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>chdir</B> <I>dir</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX25"></A>
Change the current working directory to <VAR>dir</VAR>.  For example,
<KBD>cd ~/octave</KBD> changes the current working directory to
<TT>`~/octave'</TT>.  If the directory does not exist, an error message is
printed and the working directory is not changed.
</DL>




<H4><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC23">A Sample Variable Description</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>


<P>
A <EM>variable</EM> is a name that can hold a value.  Although any variable
can be set by the user, <EM>built-in variables</EM> typically exist
specifically so that users can change them to alter the way Octave
behaves (built-in variables are also sometimes called <EM>user
options</EM>).  Ordinary variables and built-in variables are described
using a format like that for functions except that there are no
arguments.


<P>
Here is a description of the imaginary variable
<CODE>do_what_i_mean_not_what_i_say</CODE>.


<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>do_what_i_mean_not_what_i_say</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX27"></A>
If the value of this variable is nonzero, Octave will do what you
actually wanted, even if you have typed a completely different and
meaningless list of commands.
</DL>


<P>
Other variable descriptions have the same format, but `Built-in
Variable' is replaced by `Variable', for ordinary variables, or
`Constant' for symbolic constants whose values cannot be changed.
