These lisp files should work under recent versions (19 onwards) of
both Emacs and XEmacs.  See the Octave documentation (info node
`Emacs') on how to install and use these packages.

These files use the custom package so that user variables can be
changed easily.  The custom package has been included in Emacs since
around version 19.34.  If you have an old version of Emacs without the
custom package, you should get the following error when trying to load
the octave files:

  Cannot open load file: custom

In this case, you should use the simple replacement custom library
here, renaming it to custom.el so that Emacs can find it:

% mv custom-old.el custom.el

But remember when you upgrade Emacs to version 20 and beyond, you
should delete this primitive custom file and use the built-in version
instead.
