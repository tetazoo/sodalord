 XDEFUN_DLD_INTERNAL (getrusage, , , 0, "-*- texinfo -*-\n@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} getrusage ()\nReturn a structure containing a number of statistics about the current\nOctave process.  Not all fields are available on all systems.  If it is\nnot possible to get CPU time statistics, the CPU time slots are set to\nzero.  Other missing data are replaced by NaN.
