 XDEFUN_DLD_INTERNAL (fftw_wisdom, args, , 0, "-*- texinfo -*-\n@deftypefn {Loadable Function} {} fftw_wisdom (@var{file}, @var{ow})\n@deftypefnx {Loadable Function} {} fftw_wisdom (@var{n})\n\nThis function is used to manipulate the FFTW wisdom data. It can\nbe used to load previously stored wisdom from a file, create wisdom\nneeded by Octave and to save the current wisdom to a file. Wisdom\ndata can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation of the FFTs,\nbut is only profitable if the same FFT is called many times due to the\noverhead in calculating the wisdom data.\n\nCalled with a single string argument, @code{fftw_wisdom (@var{file})}\nwill load the wisdom data found in @var{file}. If @var{file} does\nnot exist, then the current wisdom used by FFTW is saved to this\nfile. If the flag @var{ow} is non-zero, then even if @var{file}\nexists, it will be overwritten.\n\nIt is assumed that each row of @var{n} represents the size of a FFT for\nwhich it is desired to pre-calculate the wisdom needed to accelerate it.\nAny value of the matrix that is less than 1, is assumed to indicate an\nabsent dimension. That is\n\n@example\nfftw_wisdom ([102, 0, 0; 103, 103, 0; 102, 103, 105]);\na = fft (rand (1,102));\nb = fft (rand (103,103));\nc = fftn (rand ([102, 103, 105]));\n@end example\n\ncalculates the wisdom necessary to accelerate the 103, 102x102 and\nthe 102x103x105 FFTs. Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when\nwhen restarting Octave. However, if it is saved as discussed above, it\ncan be reloaded. Also, any system-wide wisdom file that has been found\nwill also be used. Saved wisdom files should not be used on different\nplatforms since they will not be efficient and the point of calculating\nthe wisdom is lost.\n\nNote that the program @code{fftw-wisdom} supplied with FFTW can equally\nbe used to create a file containing wisdom that can be imported into\nOctave.\n@end deftypefn\n@seealso {fft, ifft, fft2, ifft2, fftn, ifftn}")
