.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fB\s-1GD\s0.pm\fR is a patched version of the port of Thomas Boutell's gd 
graphics library (see
below). \s-1GD\s0 allows you to create color drawings using a large number of
graphics primitives, and emit the drawings as \s-1PNG\s0 files.
.PP
The patches reintroduce \s-1GIF\s0 support.
.PP
\&\s-1GD\s0 defines the following three classes:
.if n .Ip "\f(CW""""GD::Image""""\fR" 5
.el .Ip "\f(CWGD::Image\fR" 5
.IX Item "GD::Image"
An image class, which holds the image data and accepts graphic
primitive method calls.
.if n .Ip "\f(CW""""GD::Font""""\fR" 5
.el .Ip "\f(CWGD::Font\fR" 5
.IX Item "GD::Font"
A font class, which holds static font information and used for text
rendering.
.if n .Ip "\f(CW""""GD::Polygon""""\fR" 5
.el .Ip "\f(CWGD::Polygon\fR" 5
.IX Item "GD::Polygon"
A simple polygon object, used for storing lists of vertices prior to
rendering a polygon into an image.
.PP

.SH "Object Constructors: Creating Images"
.IX Header "Object Constructors: Creating Images"
The following class methods allow you to create new \s-1GD:\s0:Image objects.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->new([$width,$height])\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->new([$width,$height])"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->new(*FILEHANDLE)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->new(*FILEHANDLE)"
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->new($filename)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->new($filename)"
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->new($data)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->new($data)"
.PD
The \fInew()\fR method is the main constructor for the \s-1GD:\s0:Image class.
Called with two integer arguments, it creates a new blank image of the
specified width and height. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $myImage = new GD::Image(100,100) || die;
.Ve
This will create an image that is 100 x 100 pixels wide.  If you don't
specify the dimensions, a default of 64 x 64 will be chosen. 
.Sp
Alternatively, you may create a \s-1GD:\s0:Image object based on an existing
image by providing an open filehandle, a filename, or the image data
itself.  The image formats automatically recognized and accepted are:
\&\s-1PNG\s0, \s-1JPEG\s0, \s-1XPM\s0 and \s-1GD2\s0.  Other formats, including \s-1GIF\s0, \s-1WBMP\s0, and \s-1GD\s0
version 1, cannot be recognized automatically at this time.
.Sp
If something goes wrong (e.g. insufficient memory), this call will
return undef.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromPng($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromPng($file)"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromPngData($data)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromPngData($data)"
.PD
The \fInewFromPng()\fR method will create an image from a \s-1PNG\s0 file read in
through the provided filehandle or file path.  The filehandle must
previously have been opened on a valid \s-1PNG\s0 file or pipe.  If
successful, this call will return an initialized image which you can
then manipulate as you please.  If it fails, which usually happens if
the thing at the other end of the filehandle is not a valid \s-1PNG\s0 file,
the call returns undef.  Notice that the call doesn't automatically
close the filehandle for you.  But it does call \f(CW\*(C`binmode(FILEHANDLE)\*(C'\fR
for you, on platforms where this matters.
.Sp
You may use any of the following as the argument:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  1) a simple filehandle, such as STDIN
\&  2) a filehandle glob, such as *PNG
\&  3) a reference to a glob, such as \e*PNG
\&  4) an IO::Handle object
\&  5) the pathname of a file
.Ve
In the latter case, \fInewFromPng()\fR will attempt to open the file for you
and read the \s-1PNG\s0 information from it.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Example1:
.Ve
.Vb 3
\&  open (PNG,"barnswallow.png") || die;
\&  $myImage = newFromPng GD::Image(\e*PNG) || die;
\&  close PNG;
.Ve
.Vb 2
\&  Example2:
\&  $myImage = newFromPng GD::Image('barnswallow.png');
.Ve
To get information about the size and color usage of the information,
you can call the image query methods described below.
.Sp
The \fInewFromPngData()\fR method will create a new \s-1GD:\s0:Image initialized
with the \s-1PNG\s0 format \fBdata\fR contained in \f(CW\*(C`$data\*(C'\fR.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromJpeg($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromJpeg($file)"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromJpegData($data)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromJpegData($data)"
.PD
These methods will create an image from a \s-1JPEG\s0 file.  They work just
like \fInewFromPng()\fR and \fInewFromPngData()\fR, and will accept the same
filehandle and pathname arguments.
.Sp
Bear in mind that \s-1JPEG\s0 is a 24\-bit format, while \s-1GD\s0 is 8\-bit.  This
means that photographic images will become posterized.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromXbm($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromXbm($file)"
This works in exactly the same way as \f(CW\*(C`newFromPng\*(C'\fR, but reads the
contents of an X Bitmap (black & white) file:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        open (XBM,"coredump.xbm") || die;
\&        $myImage = newFromXbm GD::Image(\e*XBM) || die;
\&        close XBM;
.Ve
There is no \fInewFromXbmData()\fR function, because there is no
corresponding function in the gd library.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromWMP($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromWMP($file)"
This creates a new \s-1GD:\s0:Image object starting from a WBMP-format file
or filehandle.  There is currently no \fInewFromWMPData()\fR method.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGd($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGd($file)"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGdData($data)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGdData($data)"
.PD
These methods initialize a \s-1GD:\s0:Image from a Gd file, filehandle, or
data.  Gd is Tom Boutell's disk-based storage format, intended for the
rare case when you need to read and write the image to disk quickly.
It's not intended for regular use, because, unlike \s-1PNG\s0 or \s-1JPEG\s0, no
image compression is performed and these files can become \fB\s-1BIG\s0\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        $myImage = newFromGd GD::Image("godzilla.gd") || die;
\&        close GDF;
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGd2($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGd2($file)"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGd2Data($data)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGd2Data($data)"
.PD
This works in exactly the same way as \f(CW\*(C`newFromGd()\*(C'\fR and
newFromGdData, but use the new compressed \s-1GD2\s0 image format.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGd2Part($file,srcX,srcY,width,height)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGd2Part($file,srcX,srcY,width,height)"
This class method allows you to read in just a portion of a \s-1GD2\s0 image
file.  In additionto a filehandle, it accepts the top-left corner and
dimensions (width,height) of the region of the image to read.  For
example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        open (GDF,"godzilla.gd2") || die;
\&        $myImage = GD::Image->newFromGd2Part(\e*GDF,10,20,100,100) || die;
\&        close GDF;
.Ve
This reads a 100x100 square portion of the image starting from
position (10,20).
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGif($file)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGif($file)"
.PD 0
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromGifData($data)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromGifData($data)"
.PD
This works in exactly the same way as \f(CW\*(C`newFromGd()\*(C'\fR and
newFromGdData, but use the \s-1GIF\s0 image format.
.Ip "\fB$image = \s-1GD:\s0:Image->newFromXpm($filename)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image = GD::Image->newFromXpm($filename)"
This creates a new \s-1GD:\s0:Image object starting from a \fBfilename\fR.  This
is unlike the other \fInewFrom()\fR functions because it does not take a
filehandle.  This difference comes from an inconsistency in the
underlying gd library.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $myImage = newFromXpm GD::Image('earth.xpm') || die;
.Ve
This function is only available if libgd was compiled with \s-1XPM\s0
support.  
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 The libgd library is unable to read certain \s-1XPM\s0 files, returning
an all-black image instead.
.SH "GD::Image Methods"
.IX Header "GD::Image Methods"
Once a \s-1GD:\s0:Image object is created, you can draw with it, copy it, and
merge two images.  When you are finished manipulating the object, you
can convert it into a standard image file format to output or save to
a file.
.Sh "Image Data Output Methods"
.IX Subsection "Image Data Output Methods"
The following methods convert the internal drawing format into
standard output file formats.
.Ip "\fB$pngdata = \f(CB$image\fB->png\fR" 4
.IX Item "$pngdata = $image->png"
This returns the image data in \s-1PNG\s0 format.  You can then print it,
pipe it to a display program, or write it to a file.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        $png_data = $myImage->png;
\&        open (DISPLAY,"| display -") || die;
\&        binmode DISPLAY;
\&        print DISPLAY $png_data;
\&        close DISPLAY;
.Ve
Note the use of \f(CW\*(C`binmode()\*(C'\fR.  This is crucial for portability to
DOSish platforms.
.Ip "\fB$gifdata = \f(CB$image\fB->gif\fR" 4
.IX Item "$gifdata = $image->gif"
This returns the image data in \s-1GIF\s0 format.  You can then print it,
pipe it to a display program, or write it to a file. 
.Ip "\fB$jpegdata = \f(CB$image\fB->jpeg([$quality])\fR" 4
.IX Item "$jpegdata = $image->jpeg([$quality])"
This returns the image data in \s-1JPEG\s0 format.  You can then print it,
pipe it to a display program, or write it to a file.  You may pass an
optional quality score to \fIjpeg()\fR in order to control the \s-1JPEG\s0 quality.
This should be an integer between 0 and 100.  Higher quality scores
give larger files and better image quality.  If you don't specify the
quality, \fIjpeg()\fR will choose a good default.
.Ip "\fB$gddata = \f(CB$image\fB->gd\fR" 4
.IX Item "$gddata = $image->gd"
This returns the image data in \s-1GD\s0 format.  You can then print it,
pipe it to a display program, or write it to a file.  Example:
.Sp

.Sh "Color Control"
.IX Subsection "Color Control"
These methods allow you to control and manipulate the \s-1GD:\s0:Image color
table.
.Ip "\fB$index = \f(CB$image\fB->colorAllocate(red,green,blue)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$index = $image->colorAllocate(red,green,blue)"
This allocates a color with the specified red, green and blue
components and returns its index in the color table, if specified.
The first color allocated in this way becomes the image's background
color.  (255,255,255) is white (all pixels on).  (0,0,0) is black (all
pixels off).  (255,0,0) is fully saturated red.  (127,127,127) is 50%
gray.  You can find plenty of examples in /usr/X11/lib/X11/rgb.txt.
.Sp
If no colors are allocated, then this function returns \-1.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        $white = $myImage->colorAllocate(0,0,0); #background color
\&        $black = $myImage->colorAllocate(255,255,255);

This marks the color at the specified index as being ripe for
reallocation.  The next time colorAllocate is used, this entry will be
replaced.  You can call this method several times to deallocate
multiple colors.  There's no function result from this call.
.Sp
Example:

.Ve
.Ip "\fB$index = \f(CB$image\fB->colorClosestHWB(red,green,blue)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$index = $image->colorClosestHWB(red,green,blue)"
This also attempts to return the color closest in the color table to the
red green and blue components specified. If uses a Hue/White/Black 
color representation to make the selected colour more likely to match
human perceptions of similar colors.
.Sp
If no colors have yet been

.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->transparent($colorIndex)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->transparent($colorIndex)"
This marks the color at the specified index as being transparent.
Portions of the image drawn in this color will be invisible.  This is
useful for creating paintbrushes of odd shapes, as well as for
making \s-1GIF\s0 & \s-1PNG\s0 backgrounds transparent for displaying on the Web.  Only
one color can be transparent at any time. To disable transparency, 
specify \-1 for the index.

.Sh "Special Colors"
.IX Subsection "Special Colors"
\&\s-1GD\s0 implements a number of special colors that can be used to achieve
special effects.  They are constants defined in the \s-1GD::\s0
namespace, but automatically exported into your namespace when the \s-1GD\s0
module is loaded.
.Ip "\fB$image->setBrush($image)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->setBrush($image)"
You can draw lines and shapes using a brush pattern.  Brushes are just
images that you can create and manipulate in the usual way. When you
draw with them, their contents are used for the color and shape of the
lines.
.Sp
To make a brushed line, you must create or load the brush first, then
assign it to the image using \fIsetBrush()\fR.  You can then draw in that
with that brush using the \fBgdBrushed\fR special color.  It's often
useful to set the background of the brush to transparent so that the
non-colored parts don't overwrite other parts of your image.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        # Create a brush at an angle
\&        $diagonal_brush = new GD::Image(5,5);
\&        $white = $diagonal_brush->allocateColor(255,255,255);

.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->setStyle(@colors)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->setStyle(@colors)"
Styled lines consist of an arbitrary series of repeated colors and are
useful for generating dotted and dashed lines.  To create a styled
line, use \fIsetStyle()\fR to specify a repeating series of colors.  It
accepts an array consisting of one or more color indexes.  Then draw
using the \fBgdStyled\fR special color.  Another special color,
\&\fBgdTransparent\fR can be used to introduce holes in the line, as the
example shows.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        # Set a style consisting of 4 pixels of yellow,
\&        # 4 pixels of blue, and a 2 pixel gap
\&        $myImage->setStyle($yellow,$yellow,$yellow,$yellow,
\&                           $blue,$blue,$blue,$blue,
\&                           gdTransparent,gdTransparent);
\&        $myImage->arc(50,50,25,25,0,360,gdStyled);
.Ve
To combine the \f(CW\*(C`gdStyled\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`gdBrushed\*(C'\fR behaviors, you can specify
\&\f(CW\*(C`gdStyledBrushed\*(C'\fR.  In this case, a pixel from the current brush
pattern is rendered wherever the color specified in \fIsetStyle()\fR is
neither gdTransparent nor 0.
.Ip "\fBgdTiled\fR" 4
.IX Item "gdTiled"
Draw filled shapes and flood fills using a pattern.  The pattern is
just another image.  The image will be tiled multiple times in order
to fill the required space, creating wallpaper effects.  You must call
\&\f(CW\*(C`setTile\*(C'\fR in order to define the particular tile pattern you'll use
for drawing when you specify the gdTiled color.
details.
.Ip "\fBgdStyled\fR" 4
.IX Item "gdStyled"
The gdStyled color is used for creating dashed and dotted lines.  A
styled line can contain any series of colors and is created using the
\&\fIsetStyled()\fR command.
.Sh "Drawing Commands"
.IX Subsection "Drawing Commands"
These methods allow you to draw lines, rectangles, and elipses, as
well as to perform various special operations like flood-fill.
.Ip "\fB$image->setPixel($x,$y,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->setPixel($x,$y,$color)"
This sets the pixel at (x,y) to the specified color index.  No value
is returned from this method.  The coordinate system starts at the
upper left at (0,0) and gets larger as you go down and to the right.
You can use a real color, or one of the special colors gdBrushed, 
gdStyled and gdStyledBrushed can be specified.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # This assumes $peach already allocated
\&        $myImage->setPixel(50,50,$peach);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->line($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->line($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)"
This draws a line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) of the specified color.  You
can use a real color, or one of the special colors gdBrushed, 
gdStyled and gdStyledBrushed.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        # Draw a diagonal line using the currently defind
\&        # paintbrush pattern.
\&        $myImage->line(0,0,150,150,gdBrushed);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->dashedLine($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->dashedLine($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)"
This draws a dashed line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) in the specified
color.  A more powerful way to generate arbitrary dashed and dotted
lines is to use the \fIsetStyle()\fR method described below and to draw with
the special color gdStyled.

.Ip "\fB\s-1GD:\s0:Image::rectangle($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "GD::Image::rectangle($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)"
This draws a rectangle with the specified color.  (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
are the upper left and lower right corners respectively.  Both real
color indexes and the special colors gdBrushed, gdStyled and
gdStyledBrushed are accepted.
.Sp
Example:

.Vb 1
\&        $myImage->rectangle(10,10,100,100,$rose);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->filledRectangle($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->filledRectangle($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$color)"
This draws a rectangle filed with the specified color.  You can use a
real color, or the special fill color gdTiled to fill the polygon
with a pattern.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        # read in a fill pattern and set it
\&        $tile = newFromPng GD::Image('happyface.png');
\&        $myImage->setTile($tile);

.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->polygon($polygon,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->polygon($polygon,$color)"
This draws a polygon with the specified color.  The polygon must be
created first (see below).  The polygon must have at least three
vertices.  If the last vertex doesn't close the polygon, the method
will close it for you.  Both real color indexes and the special 
colors gdBrushed, gdStyled and gdStyledBrushed can be specified.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        $poly = new GD::Polygon;
\&        $poly->addPt(50,0);
\&        $poly->addPt(99,99);

\&        $myImage->polygon($poly,$blue);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->filledPolygon($poly,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->filledPolygon($poly,$color)"
This draws a polygon filled with the specified color.  You can use a

.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->arc($cx,$cy,$width,$height,$start,$end,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->arc($cx,$cy,$width,$height,$start,$end,$color)"
This draws arcs and ellipses.  (cx,cy) are the center of the arc, and
(width,height) specify the width and height, respectively.  The
portion of the ellipse covered by the arc are controlled by start and
end, both of which are given in degrees from 0 to 360.  Zero is at the
top of the ellipse, and angles increase clockwise.  To specify a
complete ellipse, use 0 and 360 as the starting and ending angles.  To
draw a circle, use the same value for width and height.
.Sp
You can specify a normal color or one of the special colors
\&\fBgdBrushed\fR, \fBgdStyled\fR, or \fBgdStyledBrushed\fR.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # draw a semicircle centered at 100,100
\&        $myImage->arc(100,100,50,50,0,180,$blue);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->fill($x,$y,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->fill($x,$y,$color)"
This method flood-fills regions with the specified color.  The color
will spread through the image, starting at point (x,y), until it is
stopped by a pixel of a different color from the starting pixel (this
is similar to the \*(L"paintbucket\*(R" in many popular drawing toys).  You
can specify a normal color, or the special color gdTiled, to flood-fill
with patterns.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        # Draw a rectangle, and then make its interior blue
\&        $myImage->rectangle(10,10,100,100,$black);
\&        $myImage->fill(50,50,$blue);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$image->fillToBorder($x,$y,$bordercolor,$color)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->fillToBorder($x,$y,$bordercolor,$color)"
Like \f(CW\*(C`fill\*(C'\fR, this method flood-fills regions with the specified
color, starting at position (x,y).  However, instead of stopping when
it hits a pixel of a different color than the starting pixel, flooding
will only stop when it hits the color specified by bordercolor.  You
must specify a normal indexed color for the bordercolor.  However, you
are free to use the gdTiled color for the fill.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        # This has the same effect as the previous example
\&        $myImage->rectangle(10,10,100,100,$black);

.Sh "Image Copying Commands"
.IX Subsection "Image Copying Commands"
Two methods are provided for copying a rectangular region from one
image to another.  One method copies a region without resizing it.
The other allows you to stretch the region during the copy operation.
.PP
With either of these methods it is important to know that the routines
will attempt to flesh out the destination image's color table to match
the colors that are being copied from the source.  If the
destination's color table is already full, then the routines will
attempt to find the best match, with varying results.
.Ip "\fB$image->copy($sourceImage,$dstX,$dstY,$srcX,$srcY,$width,$height)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->copy($sourceImage,$dstX,$dstY,$srcX,$srcY,$width,$height)"
This is the simplest of the several copy operations, copying the
specified region from the source image to the destination image (the
one performing the method call).  (srcX,srcY) specify the upper left
corner of a rectangle in the source image, and (width,height) give the
width and height of the region to copy.  (dstX,dstY) control where in
the destination image to stamp the copy.  You can use the same image
for both the source and the destination, but the source and
destination regions must not overlap or strange things will happen.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        $myImage = new GD::Image(100,100);
\&        ... various drawing stuff ...

.IX Item "$image->copyMerge($sourceImage,$dstX,$dstY,$srcX,$srcY,$width,$height,$percent)"
This copies the indicated rectangle from the source image to the
destination image, merging the colors to the extent specified by
percent (an integer between 0 and 100).  Specifying 100% has the same
effect as \fIcopy()\fR \*(-- replacing the destination pixels with the source
image.  This is most useful for highlighting an area by merging in a
solid rectangle.

.IX Item "$image->copyMergeGray($sourceImage,$dstX,$dstY,$srcX,$srcY,$width,$height,$percent)"
This is identical to \fIcopyMerge()\fR except that it preserves the hue of
the source by converting all the pixels of the destination rectangle
to grayscale before merging.
.Ip "\fB$image->copyResized($sourceImage,$dstX,$dstY,$srcX,$srcY,$destW,$destH,$srcW,$srcH)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->copyResized($sourceImage,$dstX,$dstY,$srcX,$srcY,$destW,$destH,$srcW,$srcH)"
This method is similar to \fIcopy()\fR but allows you to choose different
sizes for the source and destination rectangles.  The source and
destination rectangle's are specified independently by (srcW,srcH) and
(destW,destH) respectively.  \fIcopyResized()\fR will stretch or shrink the
image to accomodate the size requirements.

In case of an error (such as the font not being available, or \s-1FT\s0
support not being available), the method returns an empty list and
sets $@ to the error message.
.Sp
You may also call this method from the \s-1GD:\s0:Image class name, in which
case it doesn't do any actual drawing, but returns the bounding box
using an inexpensive operation.  You can use this to perform layout
operations prior to drawing.
.Sp
For backward compatibility with older versions of the FreeType
library, the alias \fIstringTTF()\fR is also recognized.  Also be aware that
relative font paths are not recognized due to problems in the libgd
library.
.Sh "Miscellaneous Image Methods"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous Image Methods"
These are various utility methods that are useful in some
circumstances.
.Ip "\fB$image->interlaced([$flag])\fR" 4
.IX Item "$image->interlaced([$flag])"
This method sets or queries the image's interlaced setting.  Interlace
produces a cool venetian blinds effect on certain viewers.  Provide a
true parameter to set the interlace attribute.  Provide undef to
disable it.  Call the method without parameters to find out the
current setting.
.Ip "\fB($width,$height) = \f(CB$image\fB->\f(BIgetBounds()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "($width,$height) = $image->getBounds()"
This method will return a two-member list containing the width and
height of the image.  You query but not not change the size of the
image once it's created.
.Ip "\fB$flag = \f(CB$image1\fB->compare($image2)\fR" 4
.IX Item "$flag = $image1->compare($image2)"
Compare two images and return a bitmap describing the differenes
found, if any.  The return value must be logically ANDed with one or
more constants in order to determine the differences.  The following
constants are available:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  GD_CMP_IMAGE             The two images look different
\&  GD_CMP_NUM_COLORS        The two images have different numbers of colors
\&  GD_CMP_COLOR             The two images' palettes differ
\&  GD_CMP_SIZE_X            The two images differ in the horizontal dimension
\&  GD_CMP_SIZE_Y            The two images differ in the vertical dimension
\&  GD_CMP_TRANSPARENT       The two images have different transparency
\&  GD_CMP_BACKGROUND        The two images have different background colors
\&  GD_CMP_INTERLACE         The two images differ in their interlace
.Ve
The most important of these is \s-1GD_CMP_IMAGE\s0, which will tell you
whether the two images will look different, ignoring differences in the
order of colors in the color palette and other invisible changes.  The
constants are not imported by default, but must be imported individually
or by importing the :cmp tag.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  use GD qw(:DEFAULT :cmp);
\&  # get $image1 from somewhere
\&  # get $image2 from somewhere
\&  if ($image1->compare($image2) & GD_CMP_IMAGE) {
\&     warn "images differ!";
\&  }

A few primitive polygon creation and manipulation methods are
provided.  They aren't part of the Gd library, but I thought they
might be handy to have around (they're borrowed from my qd.pl
Quickdraw library).
.Ip "\fB$poly = \s-1GD:\s0:Polygon->new\fR" 3

.Ve
.Ip "\fB$poly->setPt($index,$x,$y)\fR" 3
.IX Item "$poly->setPt($index,$x,$y)"
Change the value of an already existing vertex.  It is an error to set
a vertex that isn't already defined.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $poly->setPt(2,100,100);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB($x,$y) = \f(CB$poly\fB->deletePt($index)\fR" 3
.IX Item "($x,$y) = $poly->deletePt($index)"
Delete the specified vertex, returning its value.

\&        ($x,$y) = $poly->deletePt(1);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$poly->toPt($dx,$dy)\fR" 3
.IX Item "$poly->toPt($dx,$dy)"
Draw from current vertex to a new vertex, using relative (dx,dy)
coordinates.  If this is the first point, act like \fIaddPt()\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        $poly->addPt(0,0);

\&        $points = $poly->length;
.Ve
.Ip "\fB@vertices = \f(CB$poly\fB->vertices\fR" 3
.IX Item "@vertices = $poly->vertices"
Return a list of all the verticies in the polygon object.  Each member
of the list is a reference to an (x,y) array.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        @vertices = $poly->vertices;
\&        foreach $v (@vertices)
\&           print join(",",@$v),"\en";
\&        }
.Ve
.Ip "\fB@rect = \f(CB$poly\fB->bounds\fR" 3
.IX Item "@rect = $poly->bounds"
Return the smallest rectangle that completely encloses the polygon.
The return value is an array containing the (left,top,right,bottom) of
the rectangle.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ($left,$top,$right,$bottom) = $poly->bounds;
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$poly->offset($dx,$dy)\fR" 3
.IX Item "$poly->offset($dx,$dy)"
Offset all the vertices of the polygon by the specified horizontal
(dh) and vertical (dy) amounts.  Positive numbers move the polygon
down and to the right.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $poly->offset(10,30);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$poly->map($srcL,$srcT,$srcR,$srcB,$destL,$dstT,$dstR,$dstB)\fR" 3
.IX Item "$poly->map($srcL,$srcT,$srcR,$srcB,$destL,$dstT,$dstR,$dstB)"
Map the polygon from a source rectangle to an equivalent position in a
destination rectangle, moving it and resizing it as necessary.  See
polys.pl for an example of how this works.  Both the source and
destination rectangles are given in (left,top,right,bottom)
coordinates.  For convenience, you can use the polygon's own bounding
box as the source rectangle.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # Make the polygon really tall
\&        $poly->map($poly->bounds,0,0,50,200);
.Ve
.Ip "\fB$poly->scale($sx,$sy)\fR" 3
.IX Item "$poly->scale($sx,$sy)"
Scale each vertex of the polygon by the X and Y factors indicated by
sx and sy.  For example scale(2,2) will make the polygon twice as
large.  For best results, move the center of the polygon to position
(0,0) before you scale, then move it back to its previous position.
.Ip "\fB$poly->transform($sx,$rx,$sy,$ry,$tx,$ty)\fR" 3
.IX Item "$poly->transform($sx,$rx,$sy,$ry,$tx,$ty)"
Run each vertex of the polygon through a transformation matrix, where
sx and sy are the X and Y scaling factors, rx and ry are the X and Y
rotation factors, and tx and ty are X and Y offsets.  See the Adobe
PostScript Reference, page 154 for a full explanation, or experiment.
.SH "Font Utilities"
.IX Header "Font Utilities"
The libgd library (used by the Perl \s-1GD\s0 library) has built-in support
for about half a dozen fonts, which were converted from public-domain
X Windows fonts.  For more fonts, compile libgd with TrueType support
and use the \fIstringFT()\fR call.
.PP
If you wish to add more built-in fonts, the directory bdf_scripts
contains two contributed utilities that may help you convert X-Windows
BDF-format fonts into the format that libgd uses internally.  However
these scripts were written for earlier versions of \s-1GD\s0 which included
its own mini-gd library.  These scripts will have to be adapted for
use with libgd, and the libgd library itself will have to be
recompiled and linked!  Please do not contact me for help with these
scripts: they are unsupported.
.PP
Each of these fonts is available both as an imported global
(e.g. \fBgdSmallFont\fR) and as a package method
(e.g. \fB\s-1GD:\s0:Font->Small\fR).
