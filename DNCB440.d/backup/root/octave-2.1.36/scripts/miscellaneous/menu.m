## Print a title string followed by a series of options.  Each option will
## be printed along with a number.  The return value is the number of the
## option selected by the user.  This function is useful for interactive
## programs.  There is no limit to the number of options that may be passed
## in, but it may be confusing to present more than will fit easily on one
## screen.
