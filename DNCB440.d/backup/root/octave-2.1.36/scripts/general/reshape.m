## @deftypefn {Function File} {} reshape (@var{a}, @var{m}, @var{n})
## Return a matrix with @var{m} rows and @var{n} columns whose elements are
## taken from the matrix @var{a}.  To decide how to order the elements,
## Octave pretends that the elements of a matrix are stored in column-major
## order (like Fortran arrays are stored).
##
## For example,
##
## @example
## @group
## reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)
##      @result{}  1  3
##          2  4
## @end group
## @end example
##
## If the variable @code{do_fortran_indexing} is nonzero, the
## @code{reshape} function is equivalent to
##
## @example
## @group
## retval = zeros (m, n);
## retval (:) = a;
## @end group
## @end example
##
## @noindent
## but it is somewhat less cryptic to use @code{reshape} instead of the
## colon operator.  Note that the total number of elements in the original
## matrix must match the total number of elements in the new matrix.
## @end deftypefn
