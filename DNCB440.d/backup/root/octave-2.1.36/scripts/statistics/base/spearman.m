## @deftypefn {Function File} {} spearman (@var{x}, @var{y})
## Compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficient @var{rho} for each of
## the variables specified by the input arguments.
##
## For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
## vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.
##
## @code{spearman (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{spearman (@var{x},
## @var{x})}.
##
## For two data vectors @var{x} and @var{y}, Spearman's @var{rho} is the
## correlation of the ranks of @var{x} and @var{y}.
##
## If @var{x} and @var{y} are drawn from independent distributions,
## @var{rho} has zero mean and variance @code{1 / (n - 1)}, and is
## asymptotically normally distributed.
