## Return an @var{r} by @var{c} matrix of random samples from the
## Weibull distribution with parameters @var{alpha} and @var{sigma}
## which must be scalar or of size @var{r} by @var{c}.
##
## If @var{r} and @var{c} are omitted, the size of the result matrix is
## the common size of @var{alpha} and @var{sigma}.
