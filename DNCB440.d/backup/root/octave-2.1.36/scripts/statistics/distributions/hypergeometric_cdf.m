## @deftypefn {Function File} {} hypergeometric_cdf (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{t}, @var{n})
## Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at @var{x} of the
## hypergeometric distribution with parameters @var{m}, @var{t}, and
## @var{n}.  This is the probability of obtaining not more than @var{x}
## marked items when randomly drawing a sample of size @var{n} without
## replacement from a population of total size @var{t} containing
## @var{m} marked items.
##
## The parameters @var{m}, @var{t}, and @var{n} must positive integers
## with @var{m} and @var{n} not greater than @var{t}.
