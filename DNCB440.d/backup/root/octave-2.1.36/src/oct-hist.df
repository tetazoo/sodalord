 XDEFUN_INTERNAL (edit_history, args,, true, "-*- texinfo -*-\n@deffn {Command} edit_history options\nIf invoked with no arguments, @code{edit_history} allows you to edit the\nhistory list using the editor named by the variable @code{EDITOR}.  The\ncommands to be edited are first copied to a temporary file.  When you\nexit the editor, Octave executes the commands that remain in the file.\nIt is often more convenient to use @code{edit_history} to define functions \nrather than attempting to enter them directly on the command line.\nBy default, the block of commands is executed as soon as you exit the\neditor.  To avoid executing any commands, simply delete all the lines\nfrom the buffer before exiting the editor.\n\nThe @code{edit_history} command takes two optional arguments specifying\nthe history numbers of first and last commands to edit.  For example,\nthe command\n\n@example\nedit_history 13\n@end example\n\n@noindent\nextracts all the commands from the 13th through the last in the history\nlist.  The command\n\n@example\nedit_history 13 169\n@end example\n\n@noindent\nonly extracts commands 13 through 169.  Specifying a larger number for\nthe first command than the last command reverses the list of commands\nbefore placing them in the buffer to be edited.  If both arguments are\nomitted, the previous command in the history list is used.\n@end deffn")
