It must have the form\n\n@example\ny = f (x)\n@end example\n\n@noindent\nwhere @var{y} and @var{x} are scalars.\n\nThe second and third arguments are limits of integration.  Either or\nboth may be infinite.\n\nThe optional argument @var{tol} is a vector that specifies the desired\naccuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired\nabsolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative\ntolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute\ntolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative\ntolerance to zero. \n\nThe optional argument @var{sing} is a vector of values at which the\nintegrand is known to be singular.\n\nThe result of the integration is returned in @var{v} and @var{ier}\ncontains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful integration).\nThe value of @var{nfun} indicates how many function evaluations were\nrequired, and @var{err} contains an estimate of the error in the\nsolution.\n@end deftypefn")
