Each row in the result matrices correspond to one of the\nelements in the vector @var{t}.  The first element of @var{t}\ncorresponds to the initial state @var{x0} and derivative @var{xdot0}, so\nthat the first row of the output @var{x} is @var{x0} and the first row\nof the output @var{xdot} is @var{xdot0}.\n\nThe first argument, @var{fcn}, is a string that names the function to\ncall to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.\nIt must have the form\n\n@example\n@var{res} = f (@var{x}, @var{xdot}, @var{t})\n@end example\n\n@noindent\nwhere @var{x}, @var{xdot}, and @var{res} are vectors, and @var{t} is a\nscalar.\n\nThe second and third arguments to @code{daspk} specify the initial\ncondition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument\nspecifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, \nincluding the time corresponding to the initial condition.\n\nThe set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to\nbe consistent.  In practice, however, @sc{Dassl} is not very good at\ndetermining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that\nthe initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.\n\nThe fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of\ntimes that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for\navoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a\ndiscontinuity in the derivative.\n@end deftypefn")
