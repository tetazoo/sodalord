As with @code{save},\nyou may specify a list of variables and @code{load} will only extract\nthose variables with names that match.  For example, to restore the\nvariables saved in the file @file{data}, use the command\n\n@example\nload data\n@end example\n\nOctave will refuse to overwrite existing variables unless you use the\noption @samp{-force}.\n\nIf a variable that is not marked as global is loaded from a file when a\nglobal symbol with the same name already exists, it is loaded in the\nglobal symbol table.  Also, if a variable is marked as global in a file\nand a local symbol exists, the local symbol is moved to the global\nsymbol table and given the value from the file.  Since it seems that\nboth of these cases are likely to be the result of some sort of error,\nthey will generate warnings.\n\nIf invoked with a single output argument, Octave returns data instead\nof inserting variables in the symbol table.  If the data file contains\nonly numbers (TAB- or space-delimited columns), a matrix of values is\nreturned.  Otherwise, @code{load} returns a structure with members\n corresponding to the names of the variables in the file.\n\nThe @code{load} command can read data stored in Octave's text and\nbinary formats, and @sc{Matlab}'s binary format.
