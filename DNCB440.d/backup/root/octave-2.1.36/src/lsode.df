Each row in the result matrix corresponds\nto one of the elements in the vector @var{t}.  The first element of\n@var{t} corresponds to the initial state @var{x0}, so that the first row\nof the output is @var{x0}.\n\nThe first argument, @var{fcn}, is a string that names the function to\ncall to compute the vector of right hand sides for the set of equations.\nIt must have the form\n\n@example\n@var{xdot} = f (@var{x}, @var{t})\n@end example\n\n@noindent\nwhere @var{xdot} and @var{x} are vectors and @var{t} is a scalar.\n\nThe fourth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of\ntimes that the ODE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for\navoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a\ndiscontinuity in the derivative.\n@end deftypefn")
