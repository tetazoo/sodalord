@cindex installing Octave

Here is the procedure for installing Octave from scratch on a Unix
system.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Run the shell script @file{configure}.  This will determine the features
your system has (or doesn't have) and create a file named
@file{Makefile} from each of the files named @file{Makefile.in}.

Here is a summary of the configure options that are most frequently used
when building Octave:

@table @code
@item --prefix=@var{prefix}
Install Octave in subdirectories below @var{prefix}.  The default value
of @var{prefix} is @file{/usr/local}.

@item --srcdir=@var{dir}
Look for Octave sources in the directory @var{dir}.

@item --with-f2c
Use @code{f2c} even if a Fortran compiler is available.

@item --with-g77
Use @code{g77} to compile Fortran code.

@item --enable-shared
Create shared libraries.  If you are planning to use
@code{--enable-lite-kernel} or the dynamic loading features, you will
probably want to use this option.  It will make your @file{.oct} files
much smaller and on some systems it may be necessary to build shared
libraries in order to use dynamically linked functions.

You may also want to build a shared version of @code{libstdc++}, if your
system doesn't already have one.  Note that a patch is needed to build
shared versions of version 2.7.2 of @code{libstdc++} on the HP-PA
architecture.  You can find the patch at
@url{ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++/libg++-2.7.2-hppa-gcc-fix}.

@item --enable-dl
Use @code{dlopen} and friends to make Octave capable of dynamically
linking externally compiled functions.  This only works on systems that
actually have these functions.  If you plan on using this feature, you
should probably also use @code{--enable-shared} to reduce the size of
your @file{.oct} files.

@item --enable-shl
Use @code{shl_load} and friends to make Octave capable of dynamically
linking externally compiled functions.  This only works on systems that
actually have these functions (only HP-UX systems).  If you plan on
using this feature, you should probably also use @code{--enable-shared}
to reduce the size of your @file{.oct} files.

@item --enable-lite-kernel
Compile smaller kernel.  This currently requires the dynamic linking
functions @code{dlopen} or @code{shl_load} and friends so that Octave
can load functions at run time that are not loaded at compile time.

@item --without-fastblas
Compile and use the generic BLAS and LAPACK versions included with
Octave.  By default, configure first looks for BLAS and LAPACK matrix
libraries on your system, including optimized BLAS implementations such
as the free ATLAS 3.0, as well as vendor-tuned libraries.  (The use of
an optimized BLAS will generally result in several-times faster matrix
operations.)  Only use this option if your system has BLAS/LAPACK
libraries that cause problems for some reason.  You can also use
@code{--with-fastblas=lib} to specify a particular BLAS library
@code{-llib} that configure doesn't check for automatically.

@item --help
Print a summary of the options recognized by the configure script.
@end table

See the file @file{INSTALL} for more information about the command line
options used by configure.  That file also contains instructions for
compiling in a directory other than where the source is located.

@item
Run make.

You will need a recent version of GNU Make.  Modifying Octave's
makefiles to work with other make programs is probably not worth
your time.  We recommend you get and compile GNU Make instead.

For plotting, you will need to have gnuplot installed on your system.
Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function plotting program.
Gnuplot is copyrighted, but freely distributable.  The `gnu' in gnuplot
is a coincidence---it is not related to the GNU project or the FSF in
any but the most peripheral sense.

To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
will also need @code{g++} 2.7.2 or later.  Version 2.8.0 or @code{egcs}
1.0.x should work.  Later versions may work, but C++ is still evolving,
so don't be too surprised if you run into some trouble.

It is no longer necessary to have @code{libg++}, but you do need to have
the GNU implementation of @code{libstdc++}.  If you are using @code{g++}
2.7.2, @code{libstdc++} is distributed along with @code{libg++}, but for
later versions, @code{libstdc++} is distributed separately.  For
@code{egcs}, @code{libstdc++} is included with the compiler
distribution.

If you plan to modify the parser you will also need GNU @code{bison} and
@code{flex}.  If you modify the documentation, you will need GNU
Texinfo, along with the patch for the @code{makeinfo} program that is
distributed with Octave.

GNU Make, @code{gcc}, and @code{libstdc++}, @code{gnuplot},
@code{bison}, @code{flex}, and Texinfo are all available from many
anonymous ftp archives.  The primary site is @url{ftp.gnu.org}, but it
is often very busy.  A list of sites that mirror the software on
@url{ftp.gnu.org} is available by anonymous ftp from
@url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP}.

If you don't have a Fortran compiler, or if your Fortran compiler
doesn't work like the traditional Unix f77, you will need to have the
Fortran to C translator @code{f2c}.  You can get @code{f2c} from any
number of anonymous ftp archives.  The most recent version of @code{f2c}
is always available from @url{netlib.att.com}.

On an otherwise idle Pentium 133 running Linux, it will take somewhere
between 1-1/2 to 3 hours to compile everything, depending on whether you
are building shared libraries.  You will need about 100 megabytes of disk
storage to work with (considerably less if you don't compile with debugging
symbols).  To do that, use the command

@example
make CFLAGS=-O CXXFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=
@end example

@noindent
instead of just @samp{make}.

@item
If you encounter errors while compiling Octave, first check the list of
known problems below to see if there is a workaround or solution for
your problem.  If not,
@ifclear INSTALLONLY
see @ref{Trouble},
@end ifclear
@ifset INSTALLONLY
see the file BUGS
@end ifset
for information about how to report bugs.

@item
Once you have successfully compiled Octave, run @samp{make install}.

This will install a copy of octave, its libraries, and its documentation
in the destination directory.  As distributed, Octave is installed in
the following directories.  In the table below, @var{prefix} defaults to
@file{/usr/local}, @var{version} stands for the current version number
of the interpreter, and @var{arch} is the type of computer on which
Octave is installed (for example, @samp{i586-unknown-gnu}).

@table @file
@item @var{prefix}/bin
Octave and other binaries that people will want to run directly.

@item @var{prefix}/lib
Libraries like libcruft.a and liboctave.a.

@item @var{prefix}/share
Architecture-independent data files.

@item @var{prefix}/include/octave
Include files distributed with Octave.

@item @var{prefix}/man/man1
Unix-style man pages describing Octave.

@item @var{prefix}/info
Info files describing Octave.

@item @var{prefix}/share/octave/@var{version}/m
Function files distributed with Octave.  This includes the Octave
version, so that multiple versions of Octave may be installed at the
same time.

@item @var{prefix}/lib/octave/@var{version}/exec/@var{arch}
Executables to be run by Octave rather than the user.

@item @var{prefix}/lib/octave/@var{version}/oct/@var{arch}
Object files that will be dynamically loaded.

@item @var{prefix}/share/octave/@var{version}/imagelib
Image files that are distributed with Octave.

@node Installation Problems, , Installation, Installation
@appendixsec Installation Problems

This section contains a list of problems (and some apparent problems
that don't really mean anything is wrong) that may show up during
installation of Octave.

@itemize @bullet
@item
On some SCO systems, @code{info} fails to compile if
@code{HAVE_TERMIOS_H} is defined int @file{config.h}.  Simply removing
the definition from @file{info/config.h} should allow it to compile.

@item
If @code{configure} finds @code{dlopen}, @code{dlsym}, @code{dlclose},
and @code{dlerror}, but not the header file @file{dlfcn.h}, you need to
find the source for the header file and install it in the directory
@file{usr/include}.  This is reportedly a problem with Slackware 3.1.
For Linux/GNU systems, the source for @file{dlfcn.h} is in the
@code{ldso} package.

@item
Building @file{.oct} files doesn't work.

You should probably have a shared version of @code{libstdc++}.  A patch
is needed to build shared versions of version 2.7.2 of @code{libstdc++}
on the HP-PA architecture.  You can find the patch at
@url{ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/g++/libg++-2.7.2-hppa-gcc-fix}.

@item
On some alpha systems there may be a problem with the @code{libdxml}
library, resulting in floating point errors and/or segmentation faults in
the linear algebra routines called by Octave.  If you encounter such
problems, then you should modify the configure script so that
@code{SPECIAL_MATH_LIB} is not set to @code{-ldxml}.

@item
On FreeBSD systems Octave may hang while initializing some internal
constants.  The fix appears to be to use

@example
options      GPL_MATH_EMULATE
@end example

@noindent
rather than 

@example
options      MATH_EMULATE 
@end example

@noindent
in the kernel configuration files (typically found in the directory
@file{/sys/i386/conf}.  After making this change, you'll need to rebuild
the kernel, install it, and reboot.

@item
If you encounter errors like

@smallexample
@group
passing `void (*)()' as argument 2 of
  `octave_set_signal_handler(int, void (*)(int))'
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
or

@smallexample
warning: ANSI C++ prohibits conversion from `(int)' to `(...)'
@end smallexample

@noindent
while compiling @file{sighandlers.cc}, you may need to edit some files
in the @code{gcc} include subdirectory to add proper prototypes for functions
there.  For example, Ultrix 4.2 needs proper declarations for the
@code{signal} function and the @code{SIG_IGN} macro in the file
@file{signal.h}.

On some systems the @code{SIG_IGN} macro is defined to be something like
this:

@example
#define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)())1
@end example

@noindent
when it should really be something like:

@example
#define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)(int))1
@end example

@noindent
to match the prototype declaration for the @code{signal} function.  This
change should also be made for the @code{SIG_DFL} and @code{SIG_ERR}
symbols. It may be necessary to change the definitions in
@file{sys/signal.h} as well.

The @code{gcc} @code{fixincludes} and @code{fixproto} scripts should
probably fix these problems when @code{gcc} installs its modified set of
header files, but I don't think that's been done yet.

@strong{You should not change the files in @file{/usr/include}}.  You
can find the @code{gcc} include directory tree by running the command

@example
gcc -print-libgcc-file-name
@end example

@noindent
The directory of @code{gcc} include files normally begins in the same directory
that contains the file @file{libgcc.a}.

@item
Some of the Fortran subroutines may fail to compile with older versions
of the Sun Fortran compiler.  If you get errors like

@smallexample
zgemm.f:
	zgemm:
warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
zgemm.f, line 245: warning: unexpected parent of complex
  expression subtree
warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
zgemm.f, line 304: warning: unexpected parent of complex
  expression subtree
warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
zgemm.f, line 327: warning: unexpected parent of complex
  expression subtree
pcc_binval: missing IR_CONV in complex op
make[2]: *** [zgemm.o] Error 1
@end smallexample

@noindent
when compiling the Fortran subroutines in the @file{libcruft}
subdirectory, you should either upgrade your compiler or try compiling
with optimization turned off.

@item
On NeXT systems, if you get errors like this:

@example
/usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local symbol LBB7656
/usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local symbol LBE7656
@end example

@noindent
when compiling @file{Array.cc} and @file{Matrix.cc}, try recompiling
these files without @code{-g}.

@item
Some people have reported that calls to shell_cmd and the pager do not
work on SunOS systems.  This is apparently due to having
@code{G_HAVE_SYS_WAIT} defined to be 0 instead of 1 when compiling
@code{libg++}.

@item
On NeXT systems, linking to @file{libsys_s.a} may fail to resolve the
following functions

@example
_tcgetattr
_tcsetattr
_tcflow
@end example

@noindent
which are part of @file{libposix.a}.  Unfortunately, linking Octave with
@code{-posix} results in the following undefined symbols.

@example
.destructors_used
.constructors_used
_objc_msgSend
_NXGetDefaultValue
_NXRegisterDefaults
.objc_class_name_NXStringTable
.objc_class_name_NXBundle
@end example

One kluge around this problem is to extract @file{termios.o} from
@file{libposix.a}, put it in Octave's @file{src} directory, and add it
to the list of files to link together in the makefile.  Suggestions for
better ways to solve this problem are welcome!

@item
If Octave crashes immediately with a floating point exception, it is
likely that it is failing to initialize the IEEE floating point values
for infinity and NaN.

If your system actually does support IEEE arithmetic, you should be able
to fix this problem by modifying the function @code{octave_ieee_init} in
the file @file{lo-ieee.cc} to correctly initialize Octave's internal
infinity and NaN variables.

If your system does not support IEEE arithmetic but Octave's configure
script incorrectly determined that it does, you can work around the
problem by editing the file @file{config.h} to not define
@code{HAVE_ISINF}, @code{HAVE_FINITE}, and @code{HAVE_ISNAN}.

In any case, please report this as a bug since it might be possible to
modify Octave's configuration script to automatically determine the
proper thing to do.

@item
After installing the binary distribution of Octave in an alternate
directory, the Emacs command @code{run-octave} doesn't work.  Emacs
hangs in @code{accept-process-output} in @code{inferior-octave-startup}.

This seems to be a problem with executing a shell script using the
comint package.  You can avoid the problem by changing the way Octave is
installed to eliminate the need for the shell script.  You can either
compile and install Octave using the source distribution, reinstall the
binary distribution in the default directory, or copy the commands in
the octave shell script wrapper to your shell startup files (and the
shell startup files for anyone else who is using Octave) and then
rename the file @file{octave.bin} to be @file{octave}.
