largest element of x versus abscissa @var{q}(@var{i}f) = G((@var{i} -
0.5)/@var{n}).

If the sample comes from F except for a transformation of location
and scale, the pairs will approximately follow a straight line.

The default for @var{dist} is the standard normal distribution.  The
optional argument @var{params} contains a list of parameters of
@var{dist}.  For example, for a quantile plot of the uniform
distribution on [2,4] and @var{x}, use

element of @var{x}) versus abscissa @var{p}(@var{i}) = (@var{i} -
0.5)/@var{n}.  If the sample comes from F, the pairs will
approximately follow a straight line.

For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.

@var{x})}.

For two data vectors @var{x}, @var{y} of common length @var{n},
Kendall's @var{tau} is the correlation of the signs of all rank
differences of @var{x} and @var{y};  i.e., if both @var{x} and
@var{y} have distinct entries, then

@iftex
@tex
$$ \tau = {1 \over n(n-1)} \sum_{i,j} {\rm sign}(q_i-q_j) {\rm sign}(r_i-r_j) $$

      n (n-1)   i,j
@end example
@end ifinfo

@noindent
in which the

@tex
$q_i$ and $r_i$
@end tex
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@var{q}(@var{i}) and @var{r}(@var{i})
@end ifinfo
 are the ranks of
@var{x} and @var{y}, respectively.

If @var{x} and @var{y} are drawn from independent distributions,
Kendall's @var{tau} is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and variance
@code{(2 * (2@var{n}+5)) / (9 * @var{n} * (@var{n}-1))}.

@deftypefn {Function File} {} cut (@var{x}, @var{breaks})
Create categorical data out of numerical or continuous data by
cutting into intervals.

If @var{breaks} is a scalar, the data is cut into that many
equal-width intervals.  If @var{breaks} is a vector of break points,
the category has @code{length (@var{breaks}) - 1} groups.

The returned value is a vector of the same size as @var{x} telling
which group each point in @var{x} belongs to.  Groups are labelled
from 1 to the number of groups; points outside the range of
@var{breaks} are labelled by @code{NaN}.
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-cor}

@anchor{doc-anova}
@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{pval}, @var{f}, @var{df_b}, @var{df_w}] =} anova (@var{y}, @var{g})
Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).  The goal is to test
whether the population means of data taken from @var{k} different
groups are all equal.

Data may be given in a single vector @var{y} with groups specified by
a corresponding vector of group labels @var{g} (e.g., numbers from 1
to @var{k}). This is the general form which does not impose any
restriction on the number of data in each group or the group labels.

If @var{y} is a matrix and @var{g} is omitted, each column of @var{y}
is treated as a group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced
ANOVA in which the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

Under the null of constant means, the statistic @var{f} follows an F
distribution with @var{df_b} and @var{df_w} degrees of freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{f}) is
returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is

approximately ollows a chi-square distribution with @var{df} degrees of
freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{chisq}) is
returned in @var{pval}.

If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

Given two samples @var{x} and @var{y}, perform a chisquare test for
homogeneity of the null hypothesis that @var{x} and @var{y} come from
the same distribution, based on the partition induced by the
(strictly increasing) entries of @var{c}.

For large samples, the test statistic @var{chisq} approximately follows a
chisquare distribution with @var{df} = @code{length (@var{c})}
degrees of freedom.

The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at @var{chisq}) is

@deftypefn {Function File} {} cor_test (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{alt}, @var{method})
Test whether two samples @var{x} and @var{y} come from uncorrelated
populations.

The optional argument string @var{alt} describes the alternative
hypothesis, and can be @code{"!="} or @code{"<>"} (non-zero),
@code{">"} (greater than 0), or @code{"<"} (less than 0).  The
default is the two-sided case.

The optional argument string @var{method} specifies on which
correlation coefficient the test should be based.  If @var{method} is
@code{"pearson"} (default), the (usual) Pearson's product moment
correlation coefficient is used.  In this case, the data should come
from a bivariate normal distribution.  Otherwise, the other two
methods offer nonparametric alternatives. If @var{method} is
@code{"kendall"}, then Kendall's rank correlation tau is used.  If
@var{method} is @code{"spearman"}, then Spearman's rank correlation
rho is used.  Only the first character is necessary.

The output is a structure with the following elements:

@table @var
@item pval
The p-value of the test.
@item stat
The value of the test statistic.
@item dist
The distribution of the test statistic.
@item params

Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis that the
sample @var{x} comes from the (continuous) distribution dist. I.e.,
if F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the sample and dist,
respectively, then the null is that F == G.

The optional argument @var{params} contains a list of parameters of

With the optional argument string @var{alt}, the alternative of
interest can be selected.  If @var{alt} is @code{"!="} or

@deftypefn {Function File} {} manova (@var{y}, @var{g})
Perform a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The
goal is to test whether the p-dimensional population means of data
taken from @var{k} different groups are all equal.  All data are
assumed drawn independently from p-dimensional normal distributions
with the same covariance matrix.

The data matrix is given by @var{y}.  As usual, rows are observations
and columns are variables.  The vector @var{g} specifies the
corresponding group labels (e.g., numbers from 1 to @var{k}).

The LR test statistic (Wilks' Lambda) and approximate p-values are
computed and displayed.

Perform ordinal logistic regression.

Suppose @var{y} takes values in @var{k} ordered categories, and let
@code{gamma_i (@var{x})} be the cumulative probability that @var{y}
falls in one of the first @var{i} categories given the covariate
@var{x}.  Then

@example
[theta, beta] = logistic_regression (y, x)
@end example

@noindent
fits the model

@example
logit (gamma_i (x)) = theta_i - beta' * x,   i = 1, ..., k-1
@end example

The number of ordinal categories, @var{k}, is taken to be the number
of distinct values of @code{round (@var{y})}.  If @var{k} equals 2,
@var{y} is binary and the model is ordinary logistic regression.  The
matrix @var{x} is assumed to have full column rank.

Given @var{y} only, @code{theta = logistic_regression (y)}
fits the model with baseline logit odds only.

The full form is

@example
[theta, beta, dev, dl, d2l, gamma]
   = logistic_regression (y, x, print, theta, beta)
@end example

@noindent
in which all output arguments and all input arguments except @var{y}
are optional.

Stting @var{print} to 1 requests summary information about the fitted
model to be displayed.  Setting @var{print} to 2 requests information
about convergence at each iteration.  Other values request no
information to be displayed.  The input arguments @var{theta} and
@var{beta} give initial estimates for @var{theta} and @var{beta}.

The returned value @var{dev} holds minus twice the log-likelihood.

The returned values @var{dl} and @var{d2l} are the vector of first
and the matrix of second derivatives of the log-likelihood with
respect to @var{theta} and @var{beta}.

@var{p} holds estimates for the conditional distribution of @var{y}
given @var{x}.
