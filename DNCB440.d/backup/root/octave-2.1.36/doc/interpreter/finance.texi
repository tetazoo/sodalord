@anchor{doc-fv}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} fv (@var{r}, @var{n}, @var{p}, @var{l}, @var{method})
Return the future value at the end of period @var{n} of an investment
which consists of @var{n} payments of @var{p} in each period,
assuming an interest rate @var{r}.

The optional argument @var{l} may be used to specify an
additional lump-sum payment.

The optional argument @var{method} may be used ot specify whether the
payments are made at the end (@code{"e"}, default) or at the
beginning (@code{"b"}) of each period.

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-fvl}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} fvl (@var{r}, @var{n}, @var{l})
Return the future value at the end of @var{n} periods of an initial
lump sum investment @var{l}, given a per-period interest rate
@var{r}.

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-irr}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} irr (@var{p}, @var{i})
Return the internal rate of return of a series of payments @var{p}
from an initial investment @var{i} (i.e., the solution of
@code{npv (r, p) = i}.  If the second argument is omitted, a value of
0 is used.
@end deftypefn
@seealso{npv, pv, and rate}


@anchor{doc-nper}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} nper (@var{r}, @var{p}, @var{a}, @var{l}, @var{method})
Return the number of regular payments of @var{p} necessary to
amortize @var{a} loan of amount @var{a} and interest @var{r}.

The optional argument @var{l} may be used to specify an additional
lump-sum payment of @var{l} made at the end of the amortization time.

The optional argument @var{method} may be used to specify whether
payments are made at the end (@var{"e"}, default) or at the beginning
(@var{"b"}) of each period.

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
@end deftypefn
@seealso{pv, pmt, rate, and npv}


@anchor{doc-npv}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} npv (@var{r}, @var{p}, @var{i})
Returns the net present value of a series of irregular (i.e., not
necessarily identical) payments @var{p} which occur at the ends of @var{n}
consecutive periods.  @var{r} specifies the one-period interest rates and
can either be a scalar (constant rates) or a vector of the same
length as @var{p}.

The optional argument @var{i} may be used to specify an initial
investment.

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
@end deftypefn
@seealso{irr and pv}


@anchor{doc-pmt}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} pmt (@var{r}, @var{n}, @var{a}, @var{l}, @var{method})
Return the amount of periodic payment necessary to amortize a loan
of amount a with interest rate @var{r} in @var{n} periods.

The optional argument @var{l} may be used to specify a terminal
lump-sum payment.

The optional argument @var{method} may be used to specify whether
payments are made at the end (@var{"e"}, default) or at the beginning
(@var{"b"}) of each period.
@end deftypefn
@seealso{pv, nper, and rate}


@anchor{doc-pv}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} pv (@var{r}, @var{n}, @var{p}, @var{l}, @var{method})
Returns the present value of an investment that will pay off @var{p} for @var{n}
consecutive periods, assuming an interest @var{r}.

The optional argument @var{l} may be used to specify an additional
lump-sum payment made at the end of @var{n} periods.

The optional argument @var{method} may be used to specify whether
payments are made at the end (@code{"e"}, default) or at the
beginning (@code{"b"}) of each period.

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
@end deftypefn
@seealso{pmt, nper, rate, and npv}


@anchor{doc-pvl}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} pvl (@var{r}, @var{n}, @var{p})
Return the present value of an investment that will pay off @var{p}
in one lump sum at the end of @var{n} periods, given the interest
rate @var{r}.

Note that the rate @var{r} is specified as a fraction (i.e., 0.05,
not 5 percent).
@end deftypefn


@anchor{doc-rate}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} rate (@var{n}, @var{p}, @var{v}, @var{l}, @var{method})
Return the rate of return on an investment of present value @var{v} which
pays @var{p} in @var{n} consecutive periods.

The optional argument @var{l} may be used to specify an additional
lump-sum payment made at the end of @var{n} periods.

The optional string argument @var{method} may be used to specify
whether payments are made at the end (@code{"e"}, default) or at the
beginning (@code{"b"}) of each period.
@end deftypefn
@seealso{pv, pmt, nper, and npv}


@anchor{doc-vol}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} vol (@var{x}, @var{m}, @var{n})
Return the volatility of each column of the input matrix @var{x}.
The number of data sets per period is given by @var{m} (e.g. the
number of data per year if you want to compute the volatility per
year).  The optional parameter @var{n} gives the number of past
periods used for computation, if it is omitted, a value of 1 is used.
If @var{t} is the number of rows of @var{x}, @code{vol} returns the
volatility from @code{n*m} to @var{t}.
@end deftypefn
