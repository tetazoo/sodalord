<H1><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC24">Getting Started</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter explains some of Octave's basic features, including how to
start an Octave session, get help at the command prompt, edit the
command line, and write Octave programs that can be executed as commands
from your shell.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC25">Invoking Octave</A></H2>

<P>
Normally, Octave is used interactively by running the program
<SAMP>`octave'</SAMP> without any arguments.  Once started, Octave reads
commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.

</P>
<P>
You can also specify the name of a file on the command line, and Octave
will read and execute the commands from the named file and then exit
when it is finished.

</P>
<P>
You can further control how Octave starts by using the command-line
options described in the next section, and Octave itself can remind you
of the options available.  Type <SAMP>`octave --help'</SAMP> to display all
available options and briefly describe their use (<SAMP>`octave -h'</SAMP> is a
shorter equivalent).

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC26">Command Line Options</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is a complete list of all the command line options that Octave
accepts.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>--debug</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
Enter parser debugging mode.  Using this option will cause Octave's
parser to print a lot of information about the commands it reads, and is
probably only useful if you are actually trying to debug the parser.

<DT><CODE>--echo-commands</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-x</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
Echo commands as they are executed.

<DT><CODE>--exec-path <VAR>path</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
Specify the path to search for programs to run.  The value of <VAR>path</VAR>
specified on the command line will override any value of
<CODE>OCTAVE_EXEC_PATH</CODE> found in the environment, but not any commands
in the system or user startup files that set the built-in variable
<CODE>EXEC_PATH</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-h</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-?</CODE>
<DD>

Print short help message and exit.

<DT><CODE>--info-file <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
Specify the name of the info file to use.  The value of <VAR>filename</VAR>
specified on the command line will override any value of
<CODE>OCTAVE_INFO_FILE</CODE> found in the environment, but not any commands
in the system or user startup files that set the built-in variable
<CODE>INFO_FILE</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--info-program <VAR>program</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
Specify the name of the info program to use.  The value of <VAR>program</VAR>
specified on the command line will override any value of
<CODE>OCTAVE_INFO_PROGRAM</CODE> found in the environment, but not any
commands in the system or user startup files that set the built-in
variable <CODE>INFO_PROGRAM</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--interactive</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-i</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
Force interactive behavior.  This can be useful for running Octave via a
remote shell command or inside an Emacs shell buffer.  For another way
to run Octave within Emacs, see section <A HREF="octave_38.html#SEC227">Emacs Octave Support</A>.

<DT><CODE>--no-history</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-H</CODE>
<DD>
Disable command-line history.

<DT><CODE>--path <VAR>path</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-p <VAR>path</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
Specify the path to search for function files.  The value of <VAR>path</VAR>
specified on the command line will override any value of
<CODE>OCTAVE_PATH</CODE> found in the environment, but not any commands in the
system or user startup files that set the built-in variable <CODE>LOADPATH</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>--silent</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--quiet</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>

</DL>

<P>
Octave also includes several built-in variables that contain information
about the command line, including the number of arguments and all of the
options.

</P>
<P>
@anchor{doc-argv}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>argv</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX59"></A>
The command line arguments passed to Octave are available in this
variable.  For example, if you invoked Octave using the command

</P>

<PRE>
octave --no-line-editing --silent
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>argv</CODE> would be a list of strings with the elements
<CODE>--no-line-editing</CODE> and <CODE>--silent</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you write an executable Octave script, <CODE>argv</CODE> will contain the
list of arguments passed to the script.  See section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC40">Executable Octave Programs</A>,
for an example of how to create an executable Octave script.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
@anchor{doc-program_invocation_name}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>program_invocation_name</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>program_name</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX61"></A>
When Octave starts, the value of the built-in variable
<CODE>program_invocation_name</CODE> is automatically set to the name that was
typed at the shell prompt to run Octave, and the value of
<CODE>program_name</CODE> is automatically set to the final component of
<CODE>program_invocation_name</CODE>.  For example, if you typed
<SAMP>`/usr/local/bin/octave'</SAMP> to start Octave,
<CODE>program_invocation_name</CODE> would have the value
<CODE>"/usr/local/bin/octave"</CODE>, and <CODE>program_name</CODE> would
have the value <CODE>"octave"</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If executing a script from the command line (e.g., <CODE>octave foo.m</CODE>)
or using an executable Octave script, the program name is set to the
name of the script.  See section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC40">Executable Octave Programs</A>, for an example of
how to create an executable Octave script.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
Here is an example of using these variables to reproduce Octave's
command line.

</P>

<PRE>
printf ("%s", program_name);
for i = 1:nargin
  printf (" %s", nth (argv, i));
endfor
printf ("\n");
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="octave_11.html#SEC71">Index Expressions</A>, for an explanation of how to properly index
arrays of strings and substrings in Octave, and See section <A HREF="octave_14.html#SEC97">Defining Functions</A>,
for information about the variable <CODE>nargin</CODE>.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>

</P>
<P>
When Octave starts, it looks for commands to execute from the following
files:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>octave-home</VAR>/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc</CODE>
<DD>
Where <VAR>octave-home</VAR> is the directory in which all of Octave is
installed (the default is <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>).  This file is
provided so that changes to the default Octave environment can be made
globally for all users at your site for all versions of Octave you have
installed.  Some care should be taken when making changes to this file,
since all users of Octave at your site will be affected.

<DT><CODE><VAR>octave-home</VAR>/share/octave/<VAR>version</VAR>/m/startup/octaverc</CODE>
<DD>
Where <VAR>octave-home</VAR> is the directory in which all of Octave is
installed (the default is <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>), and <VAR>version</VAR>
is the version number of Octave.  This file is provided so that changes
to the default Octave environment can be made globally for all users for
a particular version of Octave.  Some care should be taken when making
changes to this file, since all users of Octave at your site will be
affected.

<DT><CODE>~/.octaverc</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
This file is normally used to make personal changes to the default
Octave environment.

<DT><CODE>.octaverc</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
This file can be used to make changes to the default Octave environment
for a particular project.  Octave searches for this file in the current
directory after it reads <TT>`~/.octaverc'</TT>.  Any use of the <CODE>cd</CODE>
command in the <TT>`~/.octaverc'</TT> file will affect the directory that
Octave searches for the file <TT>`.octaverc'</TT>.

If you start Octave in your home directory, commands from from the file
<TT>`~/.octaverc'</TT> will only be executed once.
</DL>

<P>
A message will be displayed as each of the startup files is read if you
invoke Octave with the <CODE>--verbose</CODE> option but without the
<CODE>--silent</CODE> option.

</P>
<P>
Startup files may contain any valid Octave commands, including function
definitions.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>

</P>
<P>
The entire text of this manual is available from the Octave prompt
via the command <KBD>help -i</KBD>.  In addition, the documentation for
individual user-written functions and variables is also available via
the <KBD>help</KBD> command.  This section describes the commands used for
reading the manual and the documentation strings for user-supplied
functions and variables.  See section <A HREF="octave_14.html#SEC102">Function Files</A>, for more information
about how to document the functions you write.

</P>
<P>
@anchor{doc-help}
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>help</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX74"></A>
Octave's <CODE>help</CODE> command can be used to print brief usage-style
messages, or to display information directly from an on-line version of
the printed manual, using the GNU Info browser.  If invoked without any
arguments, <CODE>help</CODE> prints a list of all the available operators,
functions, and built-in variables.  If the first argument is <CODE>-i</CODE>,
the <CODE>help</CODE> command searches the index of the on-line version of
this manual for the given topics.

</P>
<P>
For example, the command <KBD>help help</KBD> prints a short message
describing the <CODE>help</CODE> command, and <KBD>help -i help</KBD> starts the
GNU Info browser at this node in the on-line version of the manual.

</P>
<P>
Once the GNU Info browser is running, help for using it is available
using the command <KBD>C-h</KBD>.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
The help command can give you information about operators, but not the
comma and semicolons that are used as command separators.  To get help
for those, you must type <KBD>help comma</KBD> or <KBD>help semicolon</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
@anchor{doc-INFO_FILE}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>INFO_FILE</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX75"></A>
The variable <CODE>INFO_FILE</CODE> names the location of the Octave info file.
The default value is <CODE>"<VAR>octave-home</VAR>/info/octave.info"</CODE>, in
which <VAR>octave-home</VAR> is the directory where all of Octave is installed.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
@anchor{doc-INFO_PROGRAM}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>INFO_PROGRAM</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX76"></A>
The variable <CODE>INFO_PROGRAM</CODE> names the info program to run.  Its
default initial value is
<CODE>"<VAR>octave-home</VAR>/libexec/octave/<VAR>version</VAR>/exec/<VAR>arch</VAR>/info"</CODE>
in which <VAR>octave-home</VAR> is the directory where all of Octave is
installed, <VAR>version</VAR> is the Octave version number, and <VAR>arch</VAR>
is the system type (for example, <CODE>i686-pc-linux-gnu</CODE>).  The
default initial value may be overridden by the environment variable
<CODE>OCTAVE_INFO_PROGRAM</CODE>, or the command line argument
<CODE>--info-program NAME</CODE>, or by setting the value of
<CODE>INFO_PROGRAM</CODE> in a startup script
</DL>

</P>

<P>
@anchor{doc-MAKEINFO_PROGRAM}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>MAKEINFO_PROGRAM</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX77"></A>
The variable <CODE>MAKEINFO_PROGRAM</CODE> names the makeinfo program that
Octave runs to format help text that contains Texinfo markup commands.
Its default initial value is <CODE>"makeinfo"</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
@anchor{doc-suppress_verbose_help_message}
<DL>
<DT><U>Built-in Variable:</U> <B>suppress_verbose_help_message</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX78"></A>
If the value of <CODE>suppress_verbose_help_message</CODE> is nonzero, Octave
will not add additional help information to the end of the output from
the <CODE>help</CODE> command and usage messages for built-in commands.
</DL>

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC30">Command Line Editing</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>

</P>
<P>
Octave uses the GNU readline library to provide an extensive set of
command-line editing and history features.  Only the most common
features are described in this manual.  Please see The GNU Readline
Library manual for more information.

</P>
<P>
To insert printing characters (letters, digits, symbols, etc.), simply
type the character.  Octave will insert the character at the cursor and
advance the cursor forward.

</P>
<P>
Many of the command-line editing functions operate using control
characters.  For example, the character <KBD>Control-a</KBD> moves the cursor
to the beginning of the line.  To type <KBD>C-a</KBD>, hold down <KBD>CTRL</KBD>
and then press <KBD>a</KBD>.  In the following sections, control characters
such as <KBD>Control-a</KBD> are written as <KBD>C-a</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
Another set of command-line editing functions use Meta characters.  On
some terminals, you type <KBD>M-u</KBD> by holding down <KBD>META</KBD> and
pressing <KBD>u</KBD>.  If your terminal does not have a <KBD>META</KBD> key, you
can still type Meta charcters using two-character sequences starting
with <KBD>ESC</KBD>.  Thus, to enter <KBD>M-u</KBD>, you could type
<KBD>ESC</KBD><KBD>u</KBD>.  The <KBD>ESC</KBD> character sequences are also allowed on
terminals with real Meta keys.  In the following sections, Meta
characters such as <KBD>Meta-u</KBD> are written as <KBD>M-u</KBD>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC31">Cursor Motion</A></H3>

<P>
The following commands allow you to position the cursor.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-b</KBD>
<DD>
Move back one character.

<DT><KBD>C-f</KBD>
<DD>
Move forward one character.

<DT><KBD><KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
Delete the character to the left of the cursor.

<DT><KBD>C-d</KBD>
<DD>
Delete the character underneath the cursor.

<DT><KBD>M-f</KBD>
<DD>
Move forward a word.

<DT><KBD>M-b</KBD>
<DD>
Move backward a word.

<DT><KBD>C-a</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the start of the line.

<DT><KBD>C-e</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the end of the line.

<DT><KBD>C-l</KBD>
<DD>
Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.

<DT><KBD>C-_</KBD>
<DD>
<DT><KBD>C-/</KBD>
<DD>
Undo the last thing that you did.  You can undo all the way back to an
empty line.

<DT><KBD>M-r</KBD>
<DD>
Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like typing the `undo'
command enough times to get back to the beginning.
</DL>

<P>
The above table describes the most basic possible keystrokes that you need
in order to do editing of the input line.  On most terminals, you can
also use the arrow keys in place of <KBD>C-f</KBD> and <KBD>C-b</KBD> to move
forward and backward.

</P>
<P>
Notice how <KBD>C-f</KBD> moves forward a character, while <KBD>M-f</KBD> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

</P>
<P>
There is also a function available so that you can clear the screen from
within Octave programs.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC32">Killing and Yanking</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>Killing</STRONG> text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by <STRONG>yanking</STRONG> it back into the line.
If the description for a command says that it `kills' text, then you can
be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

</P>
<P>
Here is the list of commands for killing text.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-k</KBD>
<DD>
Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

<DT><KBD>M-d</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between
words, to the end of the next word.

<DT><KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the start of the previous word, or if between
words, to the start of the previous word. 

<DT><KBD>C-w</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is different than
<KBD>M-<KBD>DEL</KBD></KBD> because the word boundaries differ.
</DL>

<P>
And, here is how to <STRONG>yank</STRONG> the text back into the line.  Yanking
means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-y</KBD>
<DD>
Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.

<DT><KBD>M-y</KBD>
<DD>
Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this if
the prior command is <KBD>C-y</KBD> or <KBD>M-y</KBD>.
</DL>

<P>
When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a <STRONG>kill-ring</STRONG>.
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it in one clean sweep.  The kill
ring is not line specific; the text that you killed on a previously
typed line is available to be yanked back later, when you are typing
another line.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC33">Commands For Changing Text</A></H3>

<P>
The following commands can be used for entering characters that would
otherwise have a special meaning (e.g., <KBD>TAB</KBD>, <KBD>C-q</KBD>, etc.), or
for quickly correcting typing mistakes.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-q</KBD>
<DD>
<DT><KBD>C-v</KBD>
<DD>
Add the next character that you type to the line verbatim.  This is
how to insert things like <KBD>C-q</KBD> for example.

<DT><KBD>M-<KBD>TAB</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
Insert a tab character.

<DT><KBD>C-t</KBD>
<DD>
Drag the character before the cursor forward over the character at the
cursor, also moving the cursor forward.  If the cursor is at the end of
the line, then transpose the two characters before it.

<DT><KBD>M-t</KBD>
<DD>
Drag the word behind the cursor past the word in front of the cursor
moving the cursor over that word as well.

<DT><KBD>M-u</KBD>
<DD>
Uppercase the characters following the cursor to the end of the current
(or following) word, moving the cursor to the end of the word.

<DT><KBD>M-l</KBD>
<DD>
Lowecase the characters following the cursor to the end of the current
(or following) word, moving the cursor to the end of the word.

Octave normally keeps track of the commands you type so that you can
recall previous commands to edit or execute them again.  When you exit
Octave, the most recent commands you have typed, up to the number
specified by the variable <CODE>history_size</CODE>, are saved in a file.
When Octave starts, it loads an initial list of commands from the file
named by the variable <CODE>history_file</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Here are the commands for simple browsing and searching the history
list.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD><KBD>LFD</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
<DT><KBD><KBD>RET</KBD></KBD>
<DD>
Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is
non-empty, add it to the history list.  If this line was a history
line, then restore the history line to its original state.

<DT><KBD>C-p</KBD>
<DD>
Move `up' through the history list.

<DT><KBD>C-n</KBD>
<DD>
Move `down' through the history list.

<DT><KBD>M-&#60;</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the first line in the history.

<DT><KBD>M-&#62;</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line you are entering!

<DT><KBD>C-r</KBD>
<DD>
Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through
the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.

<DT><KBD>C-s</KBD>
<DD>
Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down' through
the history as necessary.
</DL>

<P>
On most terminals, you can also use the arrow keys in place of <KBD>C-p</KBD>
and <KBD>C-n</KBD> to move through the history list.

</P>
<P>
In addition to the keyboard commands for moving through the history
list, Octave provides three functions for viewing, editing, and
re-running chunks of commands from the history list.

</P>
<P>
@anchor{doc-history}
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>history</B> <I>options</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX90"></A>
If invoked with no arguments, <CODE>history</CODE> displays a list of commands
that you have executed.  Valid options are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-w <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Write the current history to the file <VAR>file</VAR>.  If the name is
omitted, use the default history file (normally <TT>`~/.octave_hist'</TT>).

<DT><CODE>-r <VAR>file</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Read the file <VAR>file</VAR>, replacing the current history list with its
contents.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file
(normally <TT>`~/.octave_hist'</TT>).

<DT><CODE><VAR>n</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Only display the most recent <VAR>n</VAR> lines of history.

<DT><CODE>-q</CODE>
<DD>
Don't number the displayed lines of history.  This is useful for cutting
and pasting commands if you are using the X Window System.
</DL>

<P>
For example, to display the five most recent commands that you have
typed without displaying line numbers, use the command
<KBD>history -q 5</KBD>.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
@anchor{doc-edit_history}
<DL>
<DT><U>Command:</U> <B>edit_history</B> <I>options</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX91"></A>
If invoked with no arguments, <CODE>edit_history</CODE> allows you to edit the
history list using the editor named by the variable <CODE>EDITOR</CODE>.  The
commands to be edited are first copied to a temporary file.  When you
exit the editor, Octave executes the commands that remain in the file.
It is often more convenient to use <CODE>edit_history</CODE> to define functions 
rather than attempting to enter them directly on the command line.
By default, the block of commands is executed as soon as you exit the
editor.  To avoid executing any commands, simply delete all the lines
from the buffer before exiting the editor.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>edit_history</CODE> command takes two optional arguments specifying
the history numbers of first and last commands to edit.  For example,
the command

</P>

<PRE>
edit_history 13
</PRE>

<P>
extracts all the commands from the 13th through the last in the history
list.  The command

</P>

<PRE>
edit_history 13 169
</PRE>

<P>
only extracts commands 13 through 169.  Specifying a larger number for
the first command than the last command reverses the list of commands
before placing them in the buffer to be edited.  If both arguments are
omitted, the previous command in the history list is used.
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC39">How Octave Reports Errors</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>

</P>
<P>
Octave reports two kinds of errors for invalid programs.

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>parse error</STRONG> occurs if Octave cannot understand something you
have typed.  For example, if you misspell a keyword,

</P>

<PRE>
octave:13&#62; functon y = f (x) y = x^2; endfunction
</PRE>

<P>
Octave will respond immediately with a message like this:

</P>

<PRE>
parse error:

  functon y = f (x) y = x^2; endfunction
          ^
</PRE>

<P>
For most parse errors, Octave uses a caret (<SAMP>`^'</SAMP>) to mark the point
on the line where it was unable to make sense of your input.  In this
case, Octave generated an error message because the keyword
<CODE>function</CODE> was misspelled.  Instead of seeing <SAMP>`function f'</SAMP>,
Octave saw two consecutive variable names, which is invalid in this
context.  It marked the error at <CODE>y</CODE> because the first name by
itself was accepted as valid input.

</P>
<P>
Another class of error message occurs at evaluation time.  These
errors are called <STRONG>run-time errors</STRONG>, or sometimes
<STRONG>evaluation errors</STRONG> because they occur when your program is being
<STRONG>run</STRONG>, or <STRONG>evaluated</STRONG>.  For example, if after correcting the
mistake in the previous function definition, you type

</P>

<PRE>
octave:13&#62; f ()
</PRE>

<P>
Octave will respond with

</P>

<PRE>
error: `x' undefined near line 1 column 24
error: evaluating expression near line 1, column 24
error: evaluating assignment expression near line 1, column 22
error: called from `f'
</PRE>

<P>
This error message has several parts, and gives you quite a bit of
information to help you locate the source of the error.  The messages
are generated from the point of the innermost error, and provide a
traceback of enclosing expressions and function calls.

</P>
<P>
In the example above, the first line indicates that a variable named
<SAMP>`x'</SAMP> was found to be undefined near line 1 and column 24 of some
function or expression.  For errors occurring within functions, lines
are counted from the beginning of the file containing the function
definition.  For errors occurring at the top level, the line number
indicates the input line number, which is usually displayed in the
prompt string.

</P>
<P>
The second and third lines in the example indicate that the error
occurred within an assignment expression, and the last line of the error
message indicates that the error occurred within the function <CODE>f</CODE>.
If the function <CODE>f</CODE> had been called from another function, for
example, <CODE>g</CODE>, the list of errors would have ended with one more
line:

</P>

<PRE>
error: called from `g'
</PRE>

<P>
These lists of function calls usually make it fairly easy to trace the
path your program took before the error occurred, and to correct the
error before trying again.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>

</P>
<P>
Once you have learned Octave, you may want to write self-contained
Octave scripts, using the <SAMP>`#!'</SAMP> script mechanism.  You can do this
on GNU systems and on many Unix systems <A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="octave_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>

</P>
<P>
For example, you could create a text file named <TT>`hello'</TT>, containing
the following lines:

</P>

<PRE>
#! <VAR>octave-interpreter-name</VAR> -qf
# a sample Octave program
printf ("Hello, world!\n");
</PRE>

<P>
(where <VAR>octave-interpreter-name</VAR> should be replaced with the full
file name for your Octave binary).  After making this file executable
(with the <CODE>chmod</CODE> command), you can simply type:

</P>

<PRE>
hello
</PRE>

<P>
at the shell, and the system will arrange to run Octave as if you had
typed:

</P>

<PRE>
octave hello
</PRE>

<P>
The line beginning with <SAMP>`#!'</SAMP> lists the full file name of an
interpreter to be run, and an optional initial command line argument to
pass to that interpreter.  The operating system then runs the
interpreter with the given argument and the full argument list of the
executed program.  The first argument in the list is the full file name
of the Octave program. The rest of the argument list will either be
options to Octave, or data files, or both.  The <SAMP>`-qf'</SAMP> option is
usually specified in stand-alone Octave programs to prevent them from
printing the normal startup message, and to keep them from behaving
differently depending on the contents of a particular user's
<TT>`~/.octaverc'</TT> file.  See section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC25">Invoking Octave</A>.  Note that some
operating systems may place a limit on the number of characters that are
recognized after <SAMP>`#!'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Self-contained Octave scripts are useful when you want to write a
program which users can invoke without knowing that the program is
written in the Octave language.

</P>
<P>
If you invoke an executable Octave script with command line arguments,
the arguments are available in the built-in variable <CODE>argv</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC26">Command Line Options</A>.  For example, the following program will
reproduce the command line that is used to execute it.

</P>

<PRE>
#! /bin/octave -qf
printf ("%s", program_name);
for i = 1:nargin
  printf (" %s", argv(i,:));
endfor
printf ("\n");

<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC41">Comments in Octave Programs</A></H2>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX119"></A>

<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>comment</STRONG> is some text that is included in a program for the sake
of human readers, and that is not really part of the program.  Comments
can explain what the program does, and how it works.  Nearly all
programming languages have provisions for comments, because programs are
typically hard to understand without them.

</P>
<P>
In the Octave language, a comment starts with either the sharp sign
character, <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, or the percent symbol <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> and continues to the
end of the line.  The Octave interpreter ignores the rest of a
line following a sharp sign or percent symbol.  For example, we could
have put the following into the function <CODE>f</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
function xdot = f (x, t)

# usage: f (x, t)
#
# This function defines the right hand
# side functions for a set of nonlinear
# differential equations.

  r = 0.25;
  ...
endfunction
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>help</CODE> command (see section <A HREF="octave_3.html#SEC29">Commands for Getting Help</A>) is able to find the first
block of comments in a function (even those that are composed directly
on the command line).  This means that users of Octave can use the same
commands to get help for built-in functions, and for functions that you
have defined.  For example, after defining the function <CODE>f</CODE> above,
the command <KBD>help f</KBD> produces the output

</P>

<PRE>
 usage: f (x, t)

 This function defines the right hand
 side functions for a set of nonlinear
 differential equations.
</PRE>

<P>
Although it is possible to put comment lines into keyboard-composed
throw-away Octave programs, it usually isn't very useful, because the
purpose of a comment is to help you or another person understand the
program at a later time.
