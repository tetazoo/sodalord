#! /bin/sh

# Generate a TAGS file from a set of Octave .m files for use with Emacs.
#
# Run as '$ otags' in the given Octave directory to generate a
# TAGS file.  If you want to include another directory, add a line
# prior to the "*.m" line containing something like
#  `--include=/path/to/other/directory/TAGS" \'.

# Tags are generated for function names and for global variables. For
# global variables it doesn't work for more than one line global
# variables.  :-(

# Tags are also created for lines of the form '###key foobar' so that
# you can jump to this specific place just by typing `M-. foobar'.
# Note that tags are not generated for scripts so that you have to add
# a line by yourself of the form `###key <script-name>' if you want to
# jump to it.  :-(
