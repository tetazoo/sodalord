## Display a scaled version of the matrix @var{A} as a color image.  The
## matrix is scaled so that its entries are indices into the current
## colormap.  The scaled matrix is returned.  If @var{zoom} is omitted, a
## comfortable size is chosen.
##
## The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in
## @var{x} and @var{y}.  At present they are ignored.
