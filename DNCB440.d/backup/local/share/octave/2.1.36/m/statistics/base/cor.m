## @deftypefn {Function File} {} cor (@var{x}, @var{y})
## The (@var{i},@var{j})-th entry of @code{cor (@var{x}, @var{y})} is
## the correlation between the @var{i}-th variable in @var{x} and the
## @var{j}-th variable in @var{y}.
##
## For matrices, each row is an observation and each column a variable;
## vectors are always observations and may be row or column vectors.
##
## @code{cor (@var{x})} is equivalent to @code{cor (@var{x}, @var{x})}.
