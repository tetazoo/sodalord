.SH "NAME"
README.cygwin \- Perl for Cygwin
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This document will help you configure, make, test and install Perl
on Cygwin.  This document also describes features of Cygwin that will
affect how Perl behaves at runtime.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR There are pre-built Perl packages available for Cygwin and a
version of Perl is provided in the normal Cygwin install.  If you do
not need to customize the configuration, consider using one of those
packages.
.SH "PREREQUISITES FOR COMPILING PERL ON CYGWIN"
.IX Header "PREREQUISITES FOR COMPILING PERL ON CYGWIN"
.Sh "Cygwin = GNU+Cygnus+Windows (Don't leave \s-1UNIX\s0 without it)"
.IX Subsection "Cygwin = GNU+Cygnus+Windows (Don't leave UNIX without it)"
The Cygwin tools are ports of the popular \s-1GNU\s0 development tools for Win32
platforms.  They run thanks to the Cygwin library which provides the \s-1UNIX\s0
system calls and environment these programs expect.  More information
about this project can be found at:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  http://www.cygwin.com/
.Ve
.PP
A recent net or commercial release of Cygwin is required.
.PP
At the time this document was last updated, Cygwin 1.3.12 was current.
.Sh "Cygwin Configuration"
.IX Subsection "Cygwin Configuration"
While building Perl some changes may be necessary to your Cygwin setup so
that Perl builds cleanly.  These changes are \fBnot\fR required for normal
Perl usage.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR The binaries that are built will run on all Win32 versions.
They do not depend on your host system (Win9x/WinME, WinNT/Win2K)
or your Cygwin configuration (\fIntea\fR, \fIntsec\fR, binary/text mounts).
The only dependencies come from hard-coded pathnames like \f(CW\*(C`/usr/local\*(C'\fR.
However, your host system and Cygwin configuration will affect Perl's
runtime behavior (see \*(L"\s-1TEST\s0\*(R").
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""PATH""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CWPATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "PATH"
Set the \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR environment variable so that Configure finds the Cygwin
versions of programs.  Any Windows directories should be removed or
moved to the end of your \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu \fInroff\fR" 4
.IX Item "nroff"
If you do not have \fInroff\fR (which is part of the \fIgroff\fR package),
Configure will \fBnot\fR prompt you to install \fIman\fR pages.
.IP "\(bu Permissions" 4
.IX Item "Permissions"
On WinNT with either the \fIntea\fR or \fIntsec\fR \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\*(C'\fR settings, directory
and file permissions may not be set correctly.  Since the build process
creates directories and files, to be safe you may want to run a `\f(CW\*(C`chmod
\&\-R +w *\*(C'\fR' on the entire Perl source tree.
.Sp
Also, it is a well known WinNT \*(L"feature\*(R" that files created by a login
that is a member of the \fIAdministrators\fR group will be owned by the
\&\fIAdministrators\fR group.  Depending on your umask, you may find that you
can not write to files that you just created (because you are no longer
the owner).  When using the \fIntsec\fR \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\*(C'\fR setting, this is not an
issue because it \*(L"corrects\*(R" the ownership to what you would expect on
a \s-1UNIX\s0 system.
.SH "CONFIGURE PERL ON CYGWIN"
.IX Header "CONFIGURE PERL ON CYGWIN"
The default options gathered by Configure with the assistance of
\&\fIhints/cygwin.sh\fR will build a Perl that supports dynamic loading
(which requires a shared \fIlibperl.dll\fR).
.PP
This will run Configure and keep a record:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  ./Configure 2>&1 | tee log.configure
.Ve
.PP
If you are willing to accept all the defaults run Configure with \fB\-de\fR.
However, several useful customizations are available.
.Sh "Stripping Perl Binaries on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "Stripping Perl Binaries on Cygwin"
It is possible to strip the EXEs and DLLs created by the build process.
The resulting binaries will be significantly smaller.  If you want the
binaries to be stripped, you can either add a \fB\-s\fR option when Configure
prompts you,
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  Any additional ld flags (NOT including libraries)? [none] -s
\&  Any special flags to pass to gcc to use dynamic linking? [none] -s
\&  Any special flags to pass to ld2 to create a dynamically loaded library?
\&  [none] -s
.Ve
.PP
or you can edit \fIhints/cygwin.sh\fR and uncomment the relevant variables
near the end of the file.
.Sh "Optional Libraries for Perl on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "Optional Libraries for Perl on Cygwin"
Several Perl functions and modules depend on the existence of
some optional libraries.  Configure will find them if they are
installed in one of the directories listed as being used for library
searches.  Pre-built packages for most of these are available from
the Cygwin installer.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-lcrypt""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-lcrypt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lcrypt"
The crypt package distributed with Cygwin is a Linux compatible 56\-bit
\&\s-1DES\s0 crypt port by Corinna Vinschen.
.Sp
Alternatively, the crypt libraries in \s-1GNU\s0 libc have been ported to Cygwin.

BerkeleyDB is available for Cygwin.  Some details can be found in
\&\fIext/DB_File/DB_File.pm\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 The BerkeleyDB library only completely works on \s-1NTFS\s0 partitions.

A port of SysV \s-1IPC\s0 is available for Cygwin.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 This has \fBnot\fR been extensively tested.  In particular,
\&\f(CW\*(C`d_semctl_semun\*(C'\fR is undefined because it fails a Configure test
and on Win9x the \fIshm*()\fR functions seem to hang.  It also creates
a compile time dependency because \fIperl.h\fR includes \fI<sys/ipc.h\fR>
and \fI<sys/sem.h\fR> (which will be required in the future when compiling
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 modules).  \s-1NO\s0 \s-1LONGER\s0 \s-1SUPPORTED\s0!
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-lutil""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-lutil\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lutil"
Included with the standard Cygwin netrelease is the inetutils package 
which includes libutil.a.
.Sh "Configure-time Options for Perl on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "Configure-time Options for Perl on Cygwin"
The \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR document describes several Configure-time options.  Some of
these will work with Cygwin, others are not yet possible.  Also, some of
these are experimental.  You can either select an option when Configure
prompts you or you can define (undefine) symbols on the command line.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Uusedl""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Uusedl\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Uusedl"
Undefining this symbol forces Perl to be compiled statically.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Uusemymalloc""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Uusemymalloc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Uusemymalloc"
By default Perl uses the \fImalloc()\fR included with the Perl source.  If you
want to force Perl to build with the system \fImalloc()\fR undefine this symbol.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Uuseperlio""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Uuseperlio\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Uuseperlio"
Undefining this symbol disables the PerlIO abstraction, which is now the
default.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Dusemultiplicity""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Dusemultiplicity\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Dusemultiplicity"
Multiplicity is required when embedding Perl in a C program and using
more than one interpreter instance.  This works with the Cygwin port.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Duse64bitint""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Duse64bitint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Duse64bitint"
By default Perl uses 32 bit integers.  If you want to use larger 64
bit integers, define this symbol.  If there is trouble, check that
your Cygwin installation is up to date.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Duselongdouble""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Duselongdouble\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Duselongdouble"
\&\fIgcc\fR supports long doubles (12 bytes).  However, several additional
long double math functions are necessary to use them within Perl
(\fI{atan2, cos, exp, floor, fmod, frexp, isnan, log, modf, pow, sin, sqrt}l, 
strtold\fR).
These are \fBnot\fR yet available with Cygwin.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Dusethreads""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Dusethreads\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Dusethreads"
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 threads are \fBnot\fR yet implemented in Cygwin completely.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Duselargefiles""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Duselargefiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Duselargefiles"
Although Win32 supports large files, Cygwin currently uses 32\-bit integers
for internal size and position calculations.
.ie n .IP "\(bu ""\-Dmksymlinks""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu \f(CW\-Dmksymlinks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Dmksymlinks"
Use this to build perl outside of the source tree.  This works with Cygwin.
Details can be found in the \fI\s-1INSTALL\s0\fR document.
.Sh "Suspicious Warnings on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "Suspicious Warnings on Cygwin"
You may see some messages during Configure that seem suspicious.
.IP "\(bu \fI\fIdlsym()\fI\fR" 4
.IX Item "dlsym()"
\&\fIld2\fR is needed to build dynamic libraries, but it does not exist
when \fIdlsym()\fR checking occurs (it is not created until `\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR' runs).
You will see the following message:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  Checking whether your dlsym() needs a leading underscore ...
\&  ld2: not found
\&  I can't compile and run the test program.
\&  I'm guessing that dlsym doesn't need a leading underscore.

Since the guess is correct, this is not a problem.
.ie n .IP "\(bu Win9x and ""d_eofnblk""" 4
.el .IP "\(bu Win9x and \f(CWd_eofnblk\fR" 4
.IX Item "Win9x and d_eofnblk"
Win9x does not correctly report \f(CW\*(C`EOF\*(C'\fR with a non-blocking read on a
closed pipe.  You will see the following messages:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  But it also returns -1 to signal EOF, so be careful!

This failure does not seem to cause any problems.
.SH "MAKE ON CYGWIN"

Simply run \fImake\fR and wait:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  make 2>&1 | tee log.make
.Ve
.Sh "Warnings on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "Warnings on Cygwin"
Warnings like these are normal:

.Ve
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  dllwrap: no export definition file provided

.Ve
.Sh "ld2 on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "ld2 on Cygwin"
During `\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR', \fIld2\fR will be created and installed in your \f(CW$installbin\fR
directory (where you said to put public executables).  It does not
wait until the `\f(CW\*(C`make install\*(C'\fR' process to install the \fIld2\fR script,
this is because the remainder of the `\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR' refers to \fIld2\fR without
fully specifying its path and does this from multiple subdirectories.
The assumption is that \f(CW$installbin\fR is in your current \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.  If this
is not the case `\f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR' will fail at some point.  If this happens,
just manually copy \fIld2\fR from the source directory to somewhere in
your \f(CW\*(C`PATH\*(C'\fR.
.SH "TEST ON CYGWIN"
.IX Header "TEST ON CYGWIN"
There are two steps to running the test suite:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  make test 2>&1 | tee log.make-test
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  cd t;./perl harness 2>&1 | tee ../log.harness
.Ve
.PP
The same tests are run both times, but more information is provided when
running as `\f(CW\*(C`./perl harness\*(C'\fR'.
.PP
Test results vary depending on your host system and your Cygwin
configuration.  If a test can pass in some Cygwin setup, it is always
attempted and explainable test failures are documented.  It is possible
for Perl to pass all the tests, but it is more likely that some tests
will fail for one of the reasons listed below.
.Sh "File Permissions on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "File Permissions on Cygwin"
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 file permissions are based on sets of mode bits for
{read,write,execute} for each {user,group,other}.  By default Cygwin
only tracks the Win32 read-only attribute represented as the \s-1UNIX\s0 file
user write bit (files are always readable, files are executable if they
have a \fI.{com,bat,exe}\fR extension or begin with \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR, directories are
always readable and executable).  On WinNT with the \fIntea\fR \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\*(C'\fR
setting, the additional mode bits are stored as extended file attributes.
On WinNT with the \fIntsec\fR \f(CW\*(C`CYGWIN\*(C'\fR setting, permissions use the standard
WinNT security descriptors and access control lists.  Without one of
these options, these tests will fail (listing not updated yet):

.IX Subsection "NDBM_File does not work on FAT filesystems"
Do not install NDBM_File on \s-1FAT\s0 filesystem.  It can be built on a \s-1FAT\s0
filesystem, but many ndbm tests will fail.  With \s-1NTFS\s0, there should be
no problems either way.
.Sh "Script Portability on Cygwin"
.IX Subsection "Script Portability on Cygwin"
Cygwin does an outstanding job of providing UNIX-like semantics on top of
Win32 systems.  However, in addition to the items noted above, there are
some differences that you should know about.  This is a very brief guide
to portability, more information can be found in the Cygwin documentation.
.IP "\(bu Pathnames" 4
.IX Item "Pathnames"
Cygwin pathnames can be separated by forward (\fI/\fR) or backward (\fI\e\e\fR)
slashes.  They may also begin with drive letters (\fIC:\fR) or Universal
Naming Codes (\fI//UNC\fR).  \s-1DOS\s0 device names (\fIaux\fR, \fIcon\fR, \fIprn\fR,
\&\fIcom*\fR, \fIlpt?\fR, \fInul\fR) are invalid as base filenames.  However, they
can be used in extensions (e.g., \fIhello.aux\fR).  Names may contain all
printable characters except these:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  : * ? " < > |
.Ve
.Sp
File names are case insensitive, but case preserving.  A pathname that
contains a backslash or drive letter is a Win32 pathname (and not subject
to the translations applied to \s-1POSIX\s0 style pathnames).
.IP "\(bu Text/Binary" 4
.IX Item "Text/Binary"
When a file is opened it is in either text or binary mode.  In text mode
a file is subject to CR/LF/Ctrl\-Z translations.  With Cygwin, the default
mode for an \fIopen()\fR is determined by the mode of the mount that underlies
the file.  Perl provides a \fIbinmode()\fR function to set binary mode on files
that otherwise would be treated as text.  \fIsysopen()\fR with the \f(CW\*(C`O_TEXT\*(C'\fR
flag sets text mode on files that otherwise would be treated as binary:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sysopen(FOO, "bar", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TEXT)
.Ve
.Sp
\&\fIlseek()\fR, \fItell()\fR and \fIsysseek()\fR only work with files opened in binary mode.
.Sp
The text/binary issue is covered at length in the Cygwin documentation.
.IP "\(bu \fI.exe\fR" 4
.IX Item ".exe"
The Cygwin \fIstat()\fR, \fIlstat()\fR and \fIreadlink()\fR functions make the \fI.exe\fR
extension transparent by looking for \fIfoo.exe\fR when you ask for \fIfoo\fR
(unless a \fIfoo\fR also exists).  Cygwin does not require a \fI.exe\fR
extension, but \fIgcc\fR adds it automatically when building a program.
However, when accessing an executable as a normal file (e.g., \fIcp\fR
in a makefile) the \fI.exe\fR is not transparent.  The \fIinstall\fR included

.IP "\(bu \fIchown()\fR" 4
.IX Item "chown()"
On WinNT \fIchown()\fR can change a file's user and group IDs.  On Win9x \fIchown()\fR
is a no\-op, although this is appropriate since there is no security model.
.IP "\(bu Miscellaneous" 4
.IX Item "Miscellaneous"
File locking using the \f(CW\*(C`F_GETLK\*(C'\fR command to \fIfcntl()\fR is a stub that
returns \f(CW\*(C`ENOSYS\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Win9x can not \fIrename()\fR an open file (although WinNT can).
.Sp
The Cygwin \fIchroot()\fR implementation has holes (it can not restrict file
access by native Win32 programs).
.Sp
Inplace editing \f(CW\*(C`perl \-i\*(C'\fR of files doesn't work without doing a backup 
of the file being edited \f(CW\*(C`perl \-i.bak\*(C'\fR because of windowish restrictions,
so Perl adds the \f(CW\*(C`.bak\*(C'\fR automatically if you just use \f(CW\*(C`perl \-i\*(C'\fR.

These are the files in the Perl release that contain references to Cygwin.
These very brief notes attempt to explain the reason for all conditional
code.  Hopefully, keeping this up to date will allow the Cygwin port to
be kept as clean as possible (listing not updated yet).

.SH "BUGS ON CYGWIN"
.IX Header "BUGS ON CYGWIN"
Support for swapping real and effective user and group IDs is incomplete.
On WinNT Cygwin provides \fIsetuid()\fR, \fIseteuid()\fR, \fIsetgid()\fR and \fIsetegid()\fR.
However, additional Cygwin calls for manipulating WinNT access tokens
and security contexts are required.
