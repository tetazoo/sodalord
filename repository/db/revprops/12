added add_dicts, which adds an arbitrary number of dictionaries (preference
given to the values in earlier dicts) - converted a bunch of string
substitutions to use "% add_dicts(locals(), globals())", etc
made cash purchases not echo zephyr status to the screen
fixed a few typos - hopefully I didn't make to many more :)
